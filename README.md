# B-UML Dataset


The **B-UML Dataset** is a large-scale dataset containing **5,000+ B-UML models**, designed to support research in **modeling languages**, **model-driven engineering (MDE)**, and **AI-assisted modeling**.

The dataset provides **multiple synchronized representations** of each model, enabling reproducible, quantitative, and scalable experimentation.

All of the BUML models are directly editable in BESSER's Web Modeling Editor

## 📦 Dataset Overview

Each entry in the B-UML Dataset includes:

- **B-UML Model**  
  Editable in the **BESSER Web Modeling Environment (WME)**

- **Model Image**  
  Rendered visual representation of the model

- **Structured Metadata**
  - Number of classes  
  - Number of associations  
  - Number of attributes  
  - Number of functions (operations)

- **Deterministic Textual Description**
  - Classes  
  - Attributes  
  - Associations  
  > Generated deterministically for reproducibility (no prompt randomness)

- **Python Code**
  - Programmatic representation of the model  
  - Suitable for automation, analysis, and ML pipelines

- **Labels / Categories**
  - Consistent labels derived from the underlying database  
  - Enable controlled experiments and category-based evaluation

## 🧠 Origin of the Dataset

The B-UML Dataset is **derived from the Ecore-based Modelset**, a well-established collection of models in the community

🔗 https://models-lab.github.io/blog/2021/modelset/

The original Ecore models were systematically transformed and enriched into **B-UML representations**, while preserving structural diversity and consistency.

## 🛠 Tool Support

- **BESSER Web Modeling Environment (WME)**  
  All B-UML models are directly editable in BESSER WME.

---

## 🎯 Intended Use Cases

The dataset is suitable for:

- Benchmarking modeling tools and transformations  
- Model-to-text and text-to-model research  
- LLM evaluation and training for modeling tasks  
- Model analysis and metrics-based studies  
- Teaching and experimentation in MDE courses  

If your evaluation previously relied on “a small illustrative example”, this dataset is for you.
