The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ocl_ecore_ElementType' is a specialization of 'EClass'.
The class 'ocl_ecore_ElementType' is a specialization of 'types_ElementType'.
The class 'ocl_ecore_Constraint' is a specialization of 'ENamedElement'.
The class 'ocl_ecore_OppositePropertyCallExp' is a specialization of 'NavigationCallExp'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ecore_ocl_EOperation' and 'ocl_ecore_CallOperationAction'. From 'ecore_ocl_EOperation', the role 'ecore_ocl_EOperation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ocl_ecore_CallOperationAction', the role 'ocl_ecore_CallOperationAction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ocl_ecore_Constraint' and 'ecore_ocl_EModelElement'. From 'ocl_ecore_Constraint', the role 'ocl_ecore_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ecore_ocl_EModelElement', the role 'ecore_ocl_EModelElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ocl_ecore_SendSignalAction' and 'ecore_ocl_EClass'. From 'ocl_ecore_SendSignalAction', the role 'ocl_ecore_SendSignalAction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ecore_ocl_EClass', the role 'ecore_ocl_EClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ocl_ecore_OppositePropertyCallExp' and 'ecore_ocl_EReference'. From 'ocl_ecore_OppositePropertyCallExp', the role 'ocl_ecore_OppositePropertyCallExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ecore_ocl_EReference', the role 'ecore_ocl_EReference' has cardinality 0..*.
