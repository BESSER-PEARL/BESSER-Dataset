The domain model 'myDot' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'myDot_Usage' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDot_DotExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDot_Reference' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDot_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDot_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Ref' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDot_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'myDot_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDot_EntityRef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDot_Ref' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DataType' defines the following possible values: 'int', 'string'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDot_Attribute' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'myDot_Reference' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'myDot_DotExpression' is a specialization of 'Ref'.
The class 'myDot_EntityRef' is a specialization of 'Ref'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDot_Entity' and 'myDot_Model'. From 'myDot_Entity', the role 'myDot_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Model', the role 'myDot_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_Model' and 'myDot_Usage'. From 'myDot_Model', the role 'myDot_Model2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Usage', the role 'myDot_Usage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_Feature' and 'myDot_Entity'. From 'myDot_Feature', the role 'myDot_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Entity', the role 'myDot_Entity4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_Reference' and 'myDot_Entity'. From 'myDot_Reference', the role 'myDot_Reference' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Entity', the role 'myDot_Entity6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_Usage' and 'myDot_Ref'. From 'myDot_Usage', the role 'myDot_Usage8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Ref', the role 'myDot_Ref' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_Ref' and 'myDot_DotExpression'. From 'myDot_Ref', the role 'myDot_Ref10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_DotExpression', the role 'myDot_DotExpression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_DotExpression' and 'myDot_Feature'. From 'myDot_DotExpression', the role 'myDot_DotExpression12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Feature', the role 'myDot_Feature13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDot_EntityRef' and 'myDot_Entity'. From 'myDot_EntityRef', the role 'myDot_EntityRef' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDot_Entity', the role 'myDot_Entity15' has cardinality 0..*.
