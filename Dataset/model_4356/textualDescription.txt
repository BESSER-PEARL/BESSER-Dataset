Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mil_Statement' and 'mil_MILModel'. From 'mil_Statement', the role 'mil_Statement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_MILModel', the role 'mil_MILModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_Value' and 'mil_LoadInstruction'. From 'mil_Value', the role 'mil_Value' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_LoadInstruction', the role 'mil_LoadInstruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_StoreInstruction' and 'mil_RegisterReference'. From 'mil_StoreInstruction', the role 'mil_StoreInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_RegisterReference', the role 'mil_RegisterReference' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_Jumper' and 'mil_JumpMarker'. From 'mil_Jumper', the role 'mil_Jumper' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_JumpMarker', the role 'mil_JumpMarker' has cardinality 0..*.
