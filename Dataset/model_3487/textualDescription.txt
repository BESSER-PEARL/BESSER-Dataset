The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'model_ForAllContextualExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'contextId', which is of type str.

'model_Conjunction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Implication' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_PrimaryExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'featureId', which is of type str.

'model_Equation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Disjunction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_ExistsContextualExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'contextId', which is of type str.

'model_Negation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_ForAllContextualExpression' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_ExistsContextualExpression' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_Equation' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_Implication' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_Disjunction' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_Conjunction' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_Negation' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'model_PrimaryExpression' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
