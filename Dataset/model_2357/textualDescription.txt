The domain model 'rdbmsMM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'rdbmsMM_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'rdbmsMM_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'rdbmsMM_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'rdbmsMM_Key' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'rdbmsMM_dummy' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
