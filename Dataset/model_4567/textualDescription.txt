The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'smarthome_ContactItem' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'smarthome_SwitchItem' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'smarthome_DimmerItem' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'smarthome_NumberItem' is a specialization of 'Item'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smarthome_Item' and 'smarthome_SmartHome'. From 'smarthome_Item', the role 'smarthome_Item' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smarthome_SmartHome', the role 'smarthome_SmartHome' has cardinality 0..*.
