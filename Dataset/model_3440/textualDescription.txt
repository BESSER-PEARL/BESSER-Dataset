The domain model 'SourceModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'SourceModel_MasterStudent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Person' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SourceModel_BachelorStudent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Student' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SourceModel_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'age', which is of type str.

'SourceModel_Professor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SourceModel_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SourceModel_Container' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SourceModel_Student' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'SourceModel_MasterStudent' is a specialization of 'Student'.
The class 'SourceModel_BachelorStudent' is a specialization of 'Student'.
The class 'SourceModel_Professor' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SourceModel_Container' and 'SourceModel_Person'. From 'SourceModel_Container', the role 'SourceModel_Container' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SourceModel_Person', the role 'SourceModel_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SourceModel_Person' and 'SourceModel_Person'. From 'SourceModel_Person', the role 'SourceModel_Person3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SourceModel_Person', the role 'SourceModel_Person1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SourceModel_Student' and 'SourceModel_Professor'. From 'SourceModel_Student', the role 'learner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SourceModel_Professor', the role 'Professor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SourceModel_Professor' and 'SourceModel_Student'. From 'SourceModel_Professor', the role 'teacher' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SourceModel_Student', the role 'Student' has cardinality 0..*.
