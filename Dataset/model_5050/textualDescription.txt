The domain model 'customerDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'customerDsl_Order' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'channel', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'customerDsl_CustomerDb' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'customerDsl_Address' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'customerDsl_StreetAddress' is a specialization of 'Address'.
The class 'customerDsl_POBox' is a specialization of 'Address'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'customerDsl_Customer' and 'customerDsl_CustomerDb'. From 'customerDsl_Customer', the role 'customerDsl_Customer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'customerDsl_CustomerDb', the role 'customerDsl_CustomerDb' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'customerDsl_Order' and 'customerDsl_CustomerDb'. From 'customerDsl_Order', the role 'customerDsl_Order' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'customerDsl_CustomerDb', the role 'customerDsl_CustomerDb2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'customerDsl_CustomerDb' and 'customerDsl_Product'. From 'customerDsl_CustomerDb', the role 'customerDsl_CustomerDb4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'customerDsl_Product', the role 'customerDsl_Product' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'customerDsl_Address' and 'customerDsl_Customer'. From 'customerDsl_Address', the role 'customerDsl_Address' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'customerDsl_Customer', the role 'customerDsl_Customer6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'customerDsl_Customer' and 'customerDsl_Order'. From 'customerDsl_Customer', the role 'customerDsl_Customer9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'customerDsl_Order', the role 'customerDsl_Order8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'customerDsl_Order' and 'customerDsl_Address'. From 'customerDsl_Order', the role 'customerDsl_Order11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'customerDsl_Address', the role 'customerDsl_Address12' has cardinality 0..*.
