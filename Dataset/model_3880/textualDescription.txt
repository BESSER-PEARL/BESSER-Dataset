It does not declare any attributes.

'expressions_Function' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'expressions_UnaryOperator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'expressions_Number' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_ParameterAccess' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_BinaryOperator' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_UnaryOperator' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_Plus' is a specialization of 'BinaryOperator'.
The class 'expressions_Minus' is a specialization of 'BinaryOperator'.
The class 'expressions_Mul' is a specialization of 'BinaryOperator'.
The class 'expressions_Div' is a specialization of 'BinaryOperator'.
The class 'expressions_Neg' is a specialization of 'UnaryOperator'.
The class 'expressions_FunctionCall' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'expressions_Parameter' and 'expressions_Function'. From 'expressions_Parameter', the role 'expressions_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Function', the role 'expressions_Function' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_Function' and 'expressions_Expression'. From 'expressions_Function', the role 'expressions_Function2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_Parameter' and 'expressions_ParameterAccess'. From 'expressions_Parameter', the role 'expressions_Parameter4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_ParameterAccess', the role 'expressions_ParameterAccess' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_BinaryOperator' and 'expressions_Expression'. From 'expressions_BinaryOperator', the role 'expressions_BinaryOperator' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_Expression' and 'expressions_BinaryOperator'. From 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_BinaryOperator', the role 'expressions_BinaryOperator8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_UnaryOperator' and 'expressions_Expression'. From 'expressions_UnaryOperator', the role 'expressions_UnaryOperator' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression11' has cardinality 0..*.
