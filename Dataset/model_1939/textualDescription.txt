Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FlightState' defines the following possible values: 'completed', 'inFlight', 'planned'.
The enumeration 'TravelState' defines the following possible values: 'luggageDroppedOf', 'onBoard', 'unknown', 'checkedIn'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Flights_Flight' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Booking' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Route' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Travel' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Person' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Airport' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Plane' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.
The class 'Flights_Gate' is a specialization of 'FlightObject'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
