The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'arduinoml_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoml_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoml_Off' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'arduinoml_On' is a specialization of 'Action'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
