The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'events_AtomicEventPattern' is a specialization of 'EventPattern'.
The class 'events_ComplexEventPattern' is a specialization of 'EventPattern'.
The class 'events_OR' is a specialization of 'ComplexEventOperator'.
The class 'events_NEG' is a specialization of 'ComplexEventOperator'.
The class 'events_FOLLOWS' is a specialization of 'ComplexEventOperator'.
The class 'events_AND' is a specialization of 'ComplexEventOperator'.
The class 'events_Multiplicity' is a specialization of 'AbstractMultiplicity'.
The class 'events_Infinite' is a specialization of 'AbstractMultiplicity'.
The class 'events_AtLeastOne' is a specialization of 'AbstractMultiplicity'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'events_EventModel' and 'events_EventPattern'. From 'events_EventModel', the role 'eventModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'events_EventPattern', the role 'EventPattern' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'events_EventPattern' and 'events_EventModel'. From 'events_EventPattern', the role 'eventPatterns' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'events_EventModel', the role 'EventModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'events_Automaton' and 'events_EventPattern'. From 'events_Automaton', the role 'events_Automaton' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'events_EventPattern', the role 'events_EventPattern' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'events_ComplexEventPattern' and 'events_ComplexEventOperator'. From 'events_ComplexEventPattern', the role 'events_ComplexEventPattern' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'events_ComplexEventOperator', the role 'events_ComplexEventOperator' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'events_ComplexEventPattern' and 'events_Timewindow'. From 'events_ComplexEventPattern', the role 'events_ComplexEventPattern5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'events_Timewindow', the role 'events_Timewindow' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'events_ComplexEventPattern' and 'events_EventPatternReference'. From 'events_ComplexEventPattern', the role 'events_ComplexEventPattern7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'events_EventPatternReference', the role 'events_EventPatternReference' has cardinality 0..*.
