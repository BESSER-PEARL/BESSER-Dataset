The domain model 'source' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'source_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'is_primary', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'source_PrimitiveDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'source_ClassDiagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'source_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'leftMultiplicity', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'source_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'source_Class' and 'source_Class'. From 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_Class' and 'source_Attribute'. From 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Attribute', the role 'source_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_Class' and 'source_Association'. From 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Association', the role 'source_Association' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_Class' and 'source_Association'. From 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Association', the role 'source_Association7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_Class' and 'source_Attribute'. From 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Attribute', the role 'source_Attribute10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_Attribute' and 'source_PrimitiveDataType'. From 'source_Attribute', the role 'source_Attribute13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_PrimitiveDataType', the role 'source_PrimitiveDataType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_ClassDiagram' and 'source_Class'. From 'source_ClassDiagram', the role 'source_ClassDiagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Class', the role 'source_Class15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_ClassDiagram' and 'source_Association'. From 'source_ClassDiagram', the role 'source_ClassDiagram17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_Association', the role 'source_Association18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'source_ClassDiagram' and 'source_PrimitiveDataType'. From 'source_ClassDiagram', the role 'source_ClassDiagram20' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'source_PrimitiveDataType', the role 'source_PrimitiveDataType21' has cardinality 0..*.
