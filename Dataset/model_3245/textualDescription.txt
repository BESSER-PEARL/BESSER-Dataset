The domain model 'profile' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'profile_Resource' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'weight', which is of type int; 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'profile_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'operation', which is of type str; 'bound', which is of type int; 'isDerivation', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str.

'profile_PlatformProfile' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ResourceType' defines the following possible values: 'port', 'power', 'cpu', 'memory', 'bandwidth'.
The enumeration 'ConstraintOperation' defines the following possible values: 'LessOrEqual', 'Equal', 'Less', 'Greater', 'GreaterOrEqual'.
The enumeration 'ConstraintType' defines the following possible values: 'Maximum', 'Minimum', 'Average'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'profile_Resource' and 'profile_PlatformProfile'. From 'profile_Resource', the role 'profile_Resource' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'profile_PlatformProfile', the role 'profile_PlatformProfile' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'profile_PlatformProfile' and 'profile_Constraint'. From 'profile_PlatformProfile', the role 'profile_PlatformProfile2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'profile_Constraint', the role 'profile_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'profile_Constraint' and 'profile_Resource'. From 'profile_Constraint', the role 'profile_Constraint4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'profile_Resource', the role 'profile_Resource5' has cardinality 0..*.
