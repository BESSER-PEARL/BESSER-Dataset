'simpleany_DocumentRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'mixed', which is of type str.

'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.

'simpleany_BookType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'author', which is of type str; 'title', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpleany_BookType' and 'simpleany_Description'. From 'simpleany_BookType', the role 'simpleany_BookType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleany_Description', the role 'simpleany_Description' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleany_Description' and 'simpleany_Description'. From 'simpleany_Description', the role 'simpleany_Description3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleany_Description', the role 'simpleany_Description1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleany_DocumentRoot' and 'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'simpleany_DocumentRoot', the role 'simpleany_DocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleany_DocumentRoot' and 'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'simpleany_DocumentRoot', the role 'simpleany_DocumentRoot6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'simpleany_EStringToStringMapEntry7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleany_DocumentRoot' and 'simpleany_LibraryType'. From 'simpleany_DocumentRoot', the role 'simpleany_DocumentRoot9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleany_LibraryType', the role 'simpleany_LibraryType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleany_LibraryType' and 'simpleany_BookType'. From 'simpleany_LibraryType', the role 'simpleany_LibraryType11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleany_BookType', the role 'simpleany_BookType12' has cardinality 0..*.
