The domain model 'relational' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 24 main class(es).

'relational_ENamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ActionTimeType' defines the following possible values: 'AFTER', 'BEFORE', 'INSTEADOF'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'relational_SQLObject' is a specialization of 'ENamedElement'.
The class 'relational_DataType' is a specialization of 'SQLObject'.
The class 'relational_TypedElement' is a specialization of 'SQLObject'.
The class 'relational_Schema' is a specialization of 'SQLObject'.
The class 'relational_Trigger' is a specialization of 'SQLObject'.
The class 'relational_Table' is a specialization of 'SQLObject'.
The class 'relational_Column' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'relational_BaseTable' is a specialization of 'Table'.
The class 'relational_Constraint' is a specialization of 'SQLObject'.
The class 'relational_TableConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'relational_ReferenceConstraint' is a specialization of 'TableConstraint'.
The class 'relational_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'ReferenceConstraint'.
The class 'relational_UniqueConstraint' is a specialization of 'ReferenceConstraint'.
The class 'relational_PrimaryKey' is a specialization of 'UniqueConstraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
