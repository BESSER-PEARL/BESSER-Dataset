The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ea_automata_Automaton' is a specialization of 'ExtendibleElement'.
The class 'ea_automata_State' is a specialization of 'ExtendibleElement'.
The class 'ea_automata_Transition' is a specialization of 'ExtendibleElement'.
The class 'ea_extensions_ExtendibleElement' is a specialization of 'IExtendible'.
The class 'ea_extensions_ExtensionElement' is a specialization of 'IExtension'.
The class 'ea_extensions_IntegerExtension' is a specialization of 'ExtensionElement'.
The class 'ea_extensions_StringExtension' is a specialization of 'ExtensionElement'.
The class 'ea_extensions_StringListExtension' is a specialization of 'ExtensionElement'.
The class 'ea_extensions_BooleanExtension' is a specialization of 'ExtensionElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ea_automata_Automaton' and 'State'. From 'ea_automata_Automaton', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'State', the role 'automata' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ea_automata_Automaton' and 'Transition'. From 'ea_automata_Automaton', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Transition', the role 'automata2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ea_automata_Automaton' and 'Module'. From 'ea_automata_Automaton', the role 'Module' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Module', the role 'automata4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ea_automata_State' and 'Automaton'. From 'ea_automata_State', the role 'Automaton' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Automaton', the role 'automata6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Transition' and 'ea_automata_State'. From 'Transition', the role 'automata9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ea_automata_State', the role 'Transition8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ea_automata_State' and 'Transition'. From 'ea_automata_State', the role 'Transition11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Transition', the role 'automata12' has cardinality 0..*.
