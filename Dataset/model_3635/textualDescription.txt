The domain model 'DFAAutomaton' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'DFAAutomaton_AlphabetSymbol' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'symbol', which is of type str.

'DFAAutomaton_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'DFAAutomaton_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isFinal', which is of type bool; 'isInitial', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'DFAAutomaton_Automaton' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'DFAAutomaton_CompositeState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'DFAAutomaton_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'DFAAutomaton_State' and 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton'. From 'DFAAutomaton_State', the role 'DFAAutomaton_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton', the role 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton' and 'DFAAutomaton_Transition'. From 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton', the role 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DFAAutomaton_Transition', the role 'DFAAutomaton_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DFAAutomaton_AlphabetSymbol' and 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton'. From 'DFAAutomaton_AlphabetSymbol', the role 'DFAAutomaton_AlphabetSymbol' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton', the role 'DFAAutomaton_Automaton4' has cardinality 0..*.
