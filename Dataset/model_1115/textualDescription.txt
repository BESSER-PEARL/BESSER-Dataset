The domain model 'statechart' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'statechart_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'label', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'metadata', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'activity', which is of type str; 'actions', which is of type str.

'statechart_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'metadata', which is of type str; 'TE', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'statechart_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'metadata', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str.

'statechart_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statechart_Node' and 'statechart_Model'. From 'statechart_Node', the role 'statechart_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statechart_Model', the role 'statechart_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statechart_Transition' and 'statechart_Model'. From 'statechart_Transition', the role 'statechart_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statechart_Model', the role 'statechart_Model2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statechart_Variable' and 'statechart_Model'. From 'statechart_Variable', the role 'statechart_Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statechart_Model', the role 'statechart_Model4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statechart_Variable' and 'statechart_Node'. From 'statechart_Variable', the role 'statechart_Variable7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statechart_Node', the role 'statechart_Node6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statechart_Node' and 'statechart_Node'. From 'statechart_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statechart_Node', the role 'Father' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statechart_Node' and 'statechart_Node'. From 'statechart_Node', the role 'Children' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statechart_Node', the role 'Node12' has cardinality 0..*.
