The domain model 'dummy' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'dummy_G' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'gString', which is of type str.

'dummy_E' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'eName', which is of type str.

'dummy_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'm', which is of type float; 'l', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str.

'dummy_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'k', which is of type float.

'dummy_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'z', which is of type float; 'y', which is of type float.

'E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dummy_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'en', which is of type str; 'x', which is of type float.

'dummy_F' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'fString', which is of type str; 'fDouble', which is of type float.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EnumExample' defines the following possible values: 'value3', 'value2', 'value1'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dummy_F' is a specialization of 'E'.
The class 'dummy_G' is a specialization of 'E'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dummy_B' and 'dummy_A'. From 'dummy_B', the role 'dummy_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dummy_A', the role 'dummy_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dummy_D' and 'dummy_A'. From 'dummy_D', the role 'dummy_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dummy_A', the role 'dummy_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dummy_A' and 'dummy_E'. From 'dummy_A', the role 'dummy_A4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dummy_E', the role 'dummy_E' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dummy_B' and 'dummy_C'. From 'dummy_B', the role 'dummy_B6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dummy_C', the role 'dummy_C' has cardinality 0..*.
