The domain model 'PetriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'marking', which is of type int.

'PetriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'weight', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_TPArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_PTArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'PetriNet_PTArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'PetriNet_TPArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNet' and 'PetriNet_Node'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Node', the role 'PetriNet_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_PTArc'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'PetriNet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PTArc', the role 'PetriNet_PTArc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PTArc' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_PTArc', the role 'PetriNet_PTArc5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'PetriNet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_TPArc' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_TPArc', the role 'PetriNet_TPArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'PetriNet_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_TPArc'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'PetriNet_Place10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_TPArc', the role 'PetriNet_TPArc9' has cardinality 0..*.
