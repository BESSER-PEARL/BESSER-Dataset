The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'graph_Boundary' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Center' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graph_Center' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'graph_Boundary' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_G'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_G', the role 'graph_G' has cardinality 0..*.
