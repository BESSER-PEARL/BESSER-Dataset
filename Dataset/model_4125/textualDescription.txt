The class 'assignment2_Primary' is a specialization of 'ExpMultDiv'.
The class 'assignment2_Parenthesis' is a specialization of 'Primary'.
The class 'assignment2_Number' is a specialization of 'Primary'.
The class 'assignment2_Exp' is a specialization of 'ExpMultDiv'.
The class 'assignment2_Plus' is a specialization of 'ExpPM'.
The class 'assignment2_Minus' is a specialization of 'ExpPM'.
The class 'assignment2_Mult' is a specialization of 'ExpMD'.
The class 'assignment2_Div' is a specialization of 'ExpMD'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'assignment2_MathExp' and 'assignment2_Model'. From 'assignment2_MathExp', the role 'assignment2_MathExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'assignment2_Model', the role 'assignment2_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'assignment2_MathExp' and 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus'. From 'assignment2_MathExp', the role 'assignment2_MathExp2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus', the role 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus' and 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus'. From 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus', the role 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus', the role 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'assignment2_EObject' and 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus'. From 'assignment2_EObject', the role 'assignment2_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus', the role 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus' and 'assignment2_ExpMultDiv'. From 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus', the role 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'assignment2_ExpMultDiv', the role 'assignment2_ExpMultDiv' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'assignment2_Parenthesis' and 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus'. From 'assignment2_Parenthesis', the role 'assignment2_Parenthesis' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus', the role 'assignment2_ExpMinusPlus11' has cardinality 0..*.
