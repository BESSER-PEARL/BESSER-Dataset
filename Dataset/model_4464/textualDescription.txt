Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EOperator' defines the following possible values: 'GT', 'LTE', 'GTE', 'DIFF', 'EQ', 'OR', 'LT', 'AND'.
The enumeration 'ESensor' defines the following possible values: 'lightFLB', 'distanceFRB', 'lightFRB', 'distanceR', 'lightFLF', 'lightR', 'lightBR', 'distanceFRF', 'distanceL', 'lightBL', 'distanceFLB', 'lightL', 'distanceFLF', 'distanceBL', 'lightFRF', 'distanceBR'.
