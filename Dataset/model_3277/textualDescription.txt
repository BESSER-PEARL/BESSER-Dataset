The domain model 'data' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'data_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'data_Variables' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'data_Variable' and 'data_Variables'. From 'data_Variable', the role 'data_Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'data_Variables', the role 'data_Variables' has cardinality 0..*.
