The domain model 'fMS' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fMS_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fMS_InitState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fMS_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fMS_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fMS_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fMS_InitState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fMS_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fMS_State' and 'fMS_FSM'. From 'fMS_State', the role 'fMS_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fMS_FSM', the role 'fMS_FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fMS_FSM' and 'fMS_Transition'. From 'fMS_FSM', the role 'fMS_FSM2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fMS_Transition', the role 'fMS_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fMS_State' and 'fMS_Transition'. From 'fMS_State', the role 'fMS_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fMS_Transition', the role 'fMS_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fMS_Transition' and 'fMS_State'. From 'fMS_Transition', the role 'fMS_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fMS_State', the role 'fMS_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
