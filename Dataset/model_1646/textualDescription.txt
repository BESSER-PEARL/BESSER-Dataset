The domain model 'helloworld123' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'helloworld123_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'helloworld123_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'helloworld123_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'helloworld123_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'helloworld123_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'helloworld123_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'helloworld123_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'helloworld123_Thing' and 'helloworld123_World'. From 'helloworld123_Thing', the role 'helloworld123_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld123_World', the role 'helloworld123_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld123_Thing' and 'helloworld123_RelatedTo'. From 'helloworld123_Thing', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld123_RelatedTo', the role '2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld123_Alias' and 'helloworld123_NamedElement'. From 'helloworld123_Alias', the role 'helloworld123_Alias' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld123_NamedElement', the role 'helloworld123_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld123_Thing' and 'helloworld123_RelatedTo'. From 'helloworld123_Thing', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld123_RelatedTo', the role '5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld123_Thing' and 'helloworld123_RelatedTo'. From 'helloworld123_Thing', the role 'helloworld123_Thing8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld123_RelatedTo', the role 'helloworld123_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
