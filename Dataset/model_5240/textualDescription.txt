The domain model 'rhs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'rhs_X' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'x', which is of type str.

'rhs_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'y', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rhs_Y' and 'rhs_X'. From 'rhs_Y', the role 'rhs_Y' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rhs_X', the role 'rhs_X' has cardinality 0..*.
