The domain model 'myDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'myDsl_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Domainmodel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDsl_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'many', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl_DataType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'myDsl_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_Domainmodel' and 'myDsl_Type'. From 'myDsl_Domainmodel', the role 'myDsl_Domainmodel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Type', the role 'myDsl_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Entity' and 'myDsl_Entity'. From 'myDsl_Entity', the role 'myDsl_Entity1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Entity', the role 'myDsl_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Feature' and 'myDsl_Entity'. From 'myDsl_Feature', the role 'myDsl_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Entity', the role 'myDsl_Entity4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Type' and 'myDsl_Feature'. From 'myDsl_Type', the role 'myDsl_Type7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Feature', the role 'myDsl_Feature6' has cardinality 0..*.
