Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind' and 'ChangingOverTime_Tree'. From 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind', the role 'NodeKind' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ChangingOverTime_Tree', the role 'tree' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ChangingOverTime_Tree' and 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind'. From 'ChangingOverTime_Tree', the role 'Tree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind', the role 'root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind' and 'ChangingOverTime_BindingKind'. From 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind', the role 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ChangingOverTime_BindingKind', the role 'ChangingOverTime_BindingKind' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ChangingOverTime_Entity' and 'ChangingOverTime_BindingKind'. From 'ChangingOverTime_Entity', the role 'ChangingOverTime_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ChangingOverTime_BindingKind', the role 'ChangingOverTime_BindingKind4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ChangingOverTime_LinkKind' and 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind'. From 'ChangingOverTime_LinkKind', the role 'ChangingOverTime_LinkKind' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind', the role 'ChangingOverTime_NodeKind6' has cardinality 0..*.
