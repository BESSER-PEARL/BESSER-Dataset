The domain model 'Expression' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Expression_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'op', which is of type str.

'Expression_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type float.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Expression_Operation' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Expression_Expression' and 'Expression_Operation'. From 'Expression_Expression', the role 'left' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Expression_Operation', the role 'Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Expression_Operation' and 'Expression_Expression'. From 'Expression_Operation', the role 'operation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Expression_Expression', the role 'Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
