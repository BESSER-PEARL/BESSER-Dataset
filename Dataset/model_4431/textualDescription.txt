The domain model 'mindstorms' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 17 main class(es).

'mindstorms_Instruction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mindstorms_GoForward' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'infinite', which is of type bool; 'cm', which is of type int.

'Instruction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Action' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mindstorms_Rotate' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'degrees', which is of type int; 'random', which is of type bool.

'mindstorms_Choreography' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mindstorms_Instruction' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mindstorms_GoForward' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'mindstorms_GoBackward' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'mindstorms_Begin' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'mindstorms_Rotate' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'mindstorms_Release' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'mindstorms_Action' is a specialization of 'Block'.
The class 'mindstorms_Block' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'mindstorms_End' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'mindstorms_Choreography' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'mindstorms_Grab' is a specialization of 'Action'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Choreography' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_Choreography', the role 'mindstorms_Choreography' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction' and 'mindstorms_Choreography'. From 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction', the role 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Choreography', the role 'mindstorms_Choreography2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction', the role 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction', the role 'mindstorms_EdgeInstruction7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction8' has cardinality 0..*.
