The domain model 'trialStatemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trialStatemachine_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'trialStatemachine_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'history', which is of type str.

'trialStatemachine_ComplexState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Region' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trialStatemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'initialState', which is of type str.

'trialStatemachine_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'trialStatemachine_LabeledTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trialStatemachine_ComplexState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'trialStatemachine_Statemachine' is a specialization of 'Region'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_LabeledTransition' and 'trialStatemachine_State'. From 'trialStatemachine_LabeledTransition', the role 'trialStatemachine_LabeledTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_State', the role 'trialStatemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_Region' and 'trialStatemachine_State'. From 'trialStatemachine_Region', the role 'trialStatemachine_Region' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_State', the role 'trialStatemachine_State2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_ComplexState' and 'trialStatemachine_Region'. From 'trialStatemachine_ComplexState', the role 'trialStatemachine_ComplexState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_Region', the role 'trialStatemachine_Region4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_Action' and 'trialStatemachine_Statemachine'. From 'trialStatemachine_Action', the role 'trialStatemachine_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_Statemachine', the role 'trialStatemachine_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_Region' and 'trialStatemachine_State'. From 'trialStatemachine_Region', the role 'trialStatemachine_Region7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_State', the role 'trialStatemachine_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_Region' and 'trialStatemachine_State'. From 'trialStatemachine_Region', the role 'trialStatemachine_Region10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_State', the role 'trialStatemachine_State11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trialStatemachine_State' and 'trialStatemachine_Region'. From 'trialStatemachine_State', the role 'trialStatemachine_State14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trialStatemachine_Region', the role 'trialStatemachine_Region13' has cardinality 0..*.
