The domain model 'a' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'a_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'c', which is of type int.

'a_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'b', which is of type str; 'a', which is of type str.

'a_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'c', which is of type float.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'a_C' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'a_A' and 'a_B'. From 'a_A', the role 'a_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_B', the role 'a_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_B' and 'a_C'. From 'a_B', the role 'cc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_C', the role 'C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_C' and 'a_B'. From 'a_C', the role 'cc3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*.
