Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'LogExp' and 'imperativeocl_AssertExp'. From 'LogExp', the role 'LogExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imperativeocl_AssertExp', the role 'imperativeocl_AssertExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imperativeocl_DictLiteralExp' and 'DictLiteralPart'. From 'imperativeocl_DictLiteralExp', the role 'imperativeocl_DictLiteralExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DictLiteralPart', the role 'DictLiteralPart' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imperativeocl_OrderedTupleLiteralExp' and 'OrderedTupleLiteralPart'. From 'imperativeocl_OrderedTupleLiteralExp', the role 'imperativeocl_OrderedTupleLiteralExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OrderedTupleLiteralPart', the role 'OrderedTupleLiteralPart' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imperativeocl_SwitchExp' and 'AltExp'. From 'imperativeocl_SwitchExp', the role 'imperativeocl_SwitchExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AltExp', the role 'AltExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imperativeocl_TryExp' and 'CatchExp'. From 'imperativeocl_TryExp', the role 'imperativeocl_TryExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CatchExp', the role 'CatchExp' has cardinality 0..*.
