The domain model 'simplerdbms' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'simplerdbms_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplerdbms_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'simplerdbms_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplerdbms_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplerdbms_Key' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplerdbms_RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'kind', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplerdbms_Column' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Key' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Schema' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Table' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
