The domain model 'simplepdl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'simplepdl_ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplepdl_RequeteDeRessource' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'quantite', which is of type int.

'simplepdl_WorkSequence' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'linkType', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_GuidanceLink' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplepdl_WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplepdl_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_Resources' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'quantite', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_Guidance' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'WorkSequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'finishToFinish', 'startToStart', 'finishToStart', 'startToFinish'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_WorkSequence' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_Guidance' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_Resources' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_RequeteDeRessource' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_GuidanceLink' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
