The domain model 'java' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'java_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'java_Greeting' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'java_Greeting' and 'java_Model'. From 'java_Greeting', the role 'java_Greeting' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'java_Model', the role 'java_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
