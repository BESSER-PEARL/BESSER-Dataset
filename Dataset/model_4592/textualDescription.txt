The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'minuml2_ActivityPartition' is a specialization of 'ActivityGroup'.
The class 'minuml2_OpaqueAction' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'minuml2_ForkNode' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'minuml2_JoinNode' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'minuml2_DecisionNode' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'minuml2_ActivityFinalNode' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'minuml2_ControlFlow' is a specialization of 'ActivityEdge'.
The class 'minuml2_ObjectFlow' is a specialization of 'ActivityEdge'.
The class 'minuml2_OpaqueExpression' is a specialization of 'ValueSpecification'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'minuml2_Activity' and 'minuml2_ActivityNode'. From 'minuml2_Activity', the role 'minuml2_Activity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minuml2_ActivityNode', the role 'minuml2_ActivityNode' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'minuml2_Activity' and 'minuml2_ActivityEdge'. From 'minuml2_Activity', the role 'minuml2_Activity2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minuml2_ActivityEdge', the role 'minuml2_ActivityEdge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'minuml2_ActivityGroup' and 'minuml2_Activity'. From 'minuml2_ActivityGroup', the role 'minuml2_ActivityGroup' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minuml2_Activity', the role 'minuml2_Activity4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'minuml2_ActivityEdge' and 'minuml2_ActivityNode'. From 'minuml2_ActivityEdge', the role 'minuml2_ActivityEdge6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minuml2_ActivityNode', the role 'minuml2_ActivityNode7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'minuml2_ActivityEdge' and 'minuml2_ActivityNode'. From 'minuml2_ActivityEdge', the role 'minuml2_ActivityEdge9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minuml2_ActivityNode', the role 'minuml2_ActivityNode10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'minuml2_ValueSpecification' and 'minuml2_ActivityEdge'. From 'minuml2_ValueSpecification', the role 'minuml2_ValueSpecification' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minuml2_ActivityEdge', the role 'minuml2_ActivityEdge12' has cardinality 0..*.
