The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'entities_SimpleProperty' is a specialization of 'Property'.
The class 'entities_ReferenceProperty' is a specialization of 'Property'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'entities_Model' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Model', the role 'entities_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Property'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Property', the role 'entities_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_ReferenceProperty'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_ReferenceProperty', the role 'entities_ReferenceProperty' has cardinality 0..*.
