The domain model 'ocltestmodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 1 main class(es).

'ocltestmodel_MyClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: '_BooleanLiteralExp', which is of type bool; 'string_greaterequals', which is of type bool; 'integer_sequence', which is of type int; 'real_lessequals', which is of type bool; '_IfExp2', which is of type str; 'collection_literals', which is of type str; 'integer_lessthan', which is of type bool; 'string_replaceAll', which is of type str; 'integer_lessequals', which is of type bool; 'integer_greaterequals', which is of type bool; 'integer_multiplication', which is of type int; 'boolean_unequal', which is of type bool; 'real_lessthan', which is of type bool; 'boolean_and', which is of type bool; 'string_addition', which is of type str; 'string_concat', which is of type str; 'string_indexOf', which is of type str; 'real_greaterequals', which is of type bool; 'real_absolute', which is of type str; 'boolean_toString', which is of type str; 'let3', which is of type int; 'string_lessequals', which is of type bool; '_RealLiteralExp', which is of type str; 'integer_division', which is of type float; 'real_greaterthan', which is of type bool; 'string_equalsIgnoreCase', which is of type bool; '_IfExp', which is of type str; 'real_toString', which is of type str; 'string_lessthan', which is of type bool; '_IntegerLiteralExp', which is of type str; 'boolean_xor', which is of type bool; 'boolean_not', which is of type bool; 'string_compareTo', which is of type str; 'boolean_or', which is of type bool; 'sequence_selectByType', which is of type str; 'tuple_literal', which is of type bool; 'sequence_count', which is of type str; '_InfixExp_NOT_PASSING_DUE_TO_BUG_IN_OCLHELPER', which is of type str; 'real_floor', which is of type str; 'let', which is of type bool; 'string_at', which is of type str; 'string_equal', which is of type bool; 'boolean_implies', which is of type bool; 'static_sequence', which is of type str; 'string_size', which is of type str; 'boolean_equal', which is of type bool; 'string_lastIndexOf', which is of type str; 'integer_toString', which is of type str; 'unEmployed', which is of type bool; '_NumberLiteralExp', which is of type str; '_StringLiteralExp', which is of type str; 'integer_maximum', which is of type int; 'integer_subtraction', which is of type int; 'real_multiplication', which is of type str; 'integer_greaterthan', which is of type bool; 'string_unequal', which is of type bool; 'orderedset_size', which is of type str; 'integer_addition', which is of type int; 'integer_modulo', which is of type int; 'real_subtraction', which is of type str; 'real_minimum', which is of type str; 'sequence_selectByKind', which is of type str; 'integer_absolute', which is of type int; 'real_maximum', which is of type str; 'let2', which is of type bool; 'real_division', which is of type str; 'string_greaterthan', which is of type bool; 'integer_minimum', which is of type int; 'real_addition', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ocltestmodel_MyClass' and 'ocltestmodel_MyClass'. From 'ocltestmodel_MyClass', the role 'ocltestmodel_MyClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ocltestmodel_MyClass', the role 'ocltestmodel_MyClass0' has cardinality 0..*.
