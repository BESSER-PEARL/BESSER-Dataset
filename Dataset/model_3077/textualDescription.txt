Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'esm_EsmEntityStateModel' and 'esm_DEntityType'. From 'esm_EsmEntityStateModel', the role 'esm_EsmEntityStateModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_DEntityType', the role 'esm_DEntityType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_IEsmState' and 'esm_IEsmStateModel'. From 'esm_IEsmState', the role 'esm_IEsmState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_IEsmStateModel', the role 'esm_IEsmStateModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_EsmTransition' and 'esm_IEsmStateModel'. From 'esm_EsmTransition', the role 'esm_EsmTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_IEsmStateModel', the role 'esm_IEsmStateModel3' has cardinality 0..*.
