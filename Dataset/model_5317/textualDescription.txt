The domain model 'main' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'subsub_SSC' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'main_subsub_SSC' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'main_M' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'main_M' and 'subsub_SSC'. From 'main_M', the role 'main_M' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'subsub_SSC', the role 'subsub_SSC' has cardinality 0..*.
