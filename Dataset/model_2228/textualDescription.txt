'studyprograms_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semesterType', which is of type str; 'semesterCode', which is of type str; 'year', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AvailableSemesters' defines the following possible values: 'Both', 'Fall', 'Spring'.
The enumeration 'Level' defines the following possible values: 'Master', 'Bachelor'.
The enumeration 'SemesterType' defines the following possible values: 'Fall', 'Spring'.
The enumeration 'Access' defines the following possible values: 'NoAccess', 'M2A', 'VA', 'O', 'VB', 'M1A'.
