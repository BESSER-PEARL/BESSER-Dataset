The domain model 'vmlogo' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'vmlogo_Context' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'vmlogo_Point' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'x', which is of type float; 'y', which is of type float.

'vmlogo_Segment' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'vmlogo_StackFrame' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'variables', which is of type str.

'vmlogo_CallStack' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'vmlogo_Turtle' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'penUp', which is of type bool; 'heading', which is of type float.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Context' and 'vmlogo_Turtle'. From 'vmlogo_Context', the role 'vmlogo_Context' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Turtle', the role 'vmlogo_Turtle' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_CallStack' and 'vmlogo_Context'. From 'vmlogo_CallStack', the role 'vmlogo_CallStack' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Context', the role 'vmlogo_Context2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Turtle' and 'vmlogo_Point'. From 'vmlogo_Turtle', the role 'vmlogo_Turtle4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Point', the role 'vmlogo_Point' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Segment' and 'vmlogo_Turtle'. From 'vmlogo_Segment', the role 'vmlogo_Segment' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Turtle', the role 'vmlogo_Turtle6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Segment' and 'vmlogo_Point'. From 'vmlogo_Segment', the role 'vmlogo_Segment8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Point', the role 'vmlogo_Point9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Point' and 'vmlogo_Segment'. From 'vmlogo_Point', the role 'vmlogo_Point12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Segment', the role 'vmlogo_Segment11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_CallStack' and 'vmlogo_StackFrame'. From 'vmlogo_CallStack', the role 'vmlogo_CallStack14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_StackFrame', the role 'vmlogo_StackFrame' has cardinality 0..*.
