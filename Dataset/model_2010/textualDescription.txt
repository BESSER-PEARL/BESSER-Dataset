The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_Log' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'source', which is of type str; 'message', which is of type str; 'timestamp', which is of type date; 'level', which is of type str.

'trace_Exception' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'message', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'LogLevel' defines the following possible values: 'FINE', 'FINEST', 'FINER', 'WARNING', 'SEVERE', 'INFO', 'CONFIG'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_Log'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_Log', the role 'trace_Log' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_Exception' and 'trace_Log'. From 'trace_Exception', the role 'trace_Exception' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_Log', the role 'trace_Log2' has cardinality 0..*.
