The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'test_EClass0' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'attr0', which is of type str; 'attr1', which is of type bool.

'test_EClass2' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'EAttribute1', which is of type int; 'EAttribute0', which is of type bool.

'test_EClass1' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'EAttribute0', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EEnum0' defines the following possible values: 'a', 'b'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_EClass0' and 'test_EClass1'. From 'test_EClass0', the role 'test_EClass0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_EClass1', the role 'test_EClass1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_EClass0' and 'test_EClass2'. From 'test_EClass0', the role 'test_EClass02' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_EClass2', the role 'test_EClass2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_EClass1' and 'test_EClass2'. From 'test_EClass1', the role 'test_EClass14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_EClass2', the role 'test_EClass25' has cardinality 0..*.
