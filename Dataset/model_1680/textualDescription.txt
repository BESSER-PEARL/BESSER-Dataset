The domain model 'yyd' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'yyd_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'yyd_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyd_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyd_Blias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyd_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'yyd_Alias' is a specialization of 'Foo'.
The class 'yyd_Blias' is a specialization of 'Foo'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'yyd_RelatedTo' and 'yyd_Thing'. From 'yyd_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyd_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyd_RelatedTo' and 'yyd_Thing'. From 'yyd_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyd_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyd_RelatedTo' and 'yyd_Foo'. From 'yyd_RelatedTo', the role 'yyd_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyd_Foo', the role 'yyd_Foo' has cardinality 0..*.
