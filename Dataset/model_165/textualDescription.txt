The domain model 'PetriNets' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNets_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'bound', which is of type int; 'itokens', which is of type int.

'PetriNets_ArcTP' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNets_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'priority', which is of type float.

'PetriNets_Token' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNets_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'weight', which is of type int.

'PetriNets_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNets_ArcPT' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNets_ArcPT' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'PetriNets_ArcTP' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
