The domain model 'TypeB' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'TypeB_ElementR' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameR', which is of type str.

'TypeB_ElementY' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameY', which is of type str.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypeB_ElementS' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameS', which is of type str.

'TypeB_AnotherElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nameElement', which is of type str; 'additionalField', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'abstractBaseName', which is of type str.

'ElementR' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypeB_SubElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'additionalField', which is of type str.

'TypeB_ListElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameListElement', which is of type str.

'ElementX' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypeB_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nameElement', which is of type str; 'abstractBaseName', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'TypeB_ElementX' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameX', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'TypeB_SubElement' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'TypeB_ElementY' is a specialization of 'ElementX'.
The class 'TypeB_ElementS' is a specialization of 'ElementR'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TypeB_ListElement' and 'Element'. From 'TypeB_ListElement', the role 'TypeB_ListElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Element', the role 'Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TypeB_ListElement' and 'Element'. From 'TypeB_ListElement', the role 'TypeB_ListElement2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Element', the role 'Element3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ElementX' and 'TypeB_ListElement'. From 'ElementX', the role 'ElementX' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeB_ListElement', the role 'TypeB_ListElement5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ElementR' and 'TypeB_ListElement'. From 'ElementR', the role 'ElementR' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeB_ListElement', the role 'TypeB_ListElement7' has cardinality 0..*.
