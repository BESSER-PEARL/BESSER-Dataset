The domain model 'faultTree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 16 main class(es).

'faultTree_ExternalEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_ProbabalisticEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'probability', which is of type float.

'faultTree_FaultTree' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FTElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_OR_Gate' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Event' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_UndevelopedEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_AND_Gate' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'faultTree_Connector' is a specialization of 'FTElement'.
The class 'faultTree_FaultTree' is a specialization of 'FTElement'.
The class 'faultTree_Event' is a specialization of 'FTElement'.
The class 'faultTree_ProbabalisticEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'faultTree_BasicEvent' is a specialization of 'ProbabalisticEvent'.
The class 'faultTree_UndevelopedEvent' is a specialization of 'ProbabalisticEvent'.
The class 'faultTree_ExternalEvent' is a specialization of 'ProbabalisticEvent'.
The class 'faultTree_IntermediateEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'faultTree_Gate' is a specialization of 'FTElement'.
The class 'faultTree_AND_Gate' is a specialization of 'Gate'.
The class 'faultTree_OR_Gate' is a specialization of 'Gate'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'faultTree_FTElement' and 'faultTree_Connector'. From 'faultTree_FTElement', the role 'faultTree_FTElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'faultTree_Connector', the role 'faultTree_Connector' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'faultTree_FTElement' and 'faultTree_Connector'. From 'faultTree_FTElement', the role 'faultTree_FTElement3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'faultTree_Connector', the role 'faultTree_Connector2' has cardinality 0..*.
