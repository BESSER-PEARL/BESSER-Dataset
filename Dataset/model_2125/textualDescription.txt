The domain model 'TestPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'SubTestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_SubPackage_SubTestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_TestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'testAttr', which is of type bool.

'TestPackage_SubPackage_SubTestInterface' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TestEnum' is defined but does not specify any literals.
The enumeration 'SubTestEnum' is defined but does not specify any literals.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TestPackage_TestClass' and 'SubTestClass'. From 'TestPackage_TestClass', the role 'TestPackage_TestClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SubTestClass', the role 'SubTestClass' has cardinality 0..*.
