The domain model 'minidrone' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'minidrone_Jump' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'jumpType', which is of type str.

'minidrone_Instruction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'minidrone_Go' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'distance', which is of type int.

'Instruction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'minidrone_MiniDroneProgram' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'minidrone_Turn' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'angle', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'JumpType' defines the following possible values: 'JUMP_HIGH', 'JUMP_MAX', 'JUMP_LONG'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'minidrone_Go' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'minidrone_Turn' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'minidrone_Jump' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'minidrone_Instruction' and 'minidrone_MiniDroneProgram'. From 'minidrone_Instruction', the role 'minidrone_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minidrone_MiniDroneProgram', the role 'minidrone_MiniDroneProgram' has cardinality 0..*.
