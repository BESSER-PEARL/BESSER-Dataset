The domain model 'CD' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'CD_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'CD_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'CD_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isAbstract', which is of type str.

'CD_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'CD_NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'CD_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'multiValued', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'CD_Classifier' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'CD_DataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'CD_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'CD_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'CD_Package' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'CD_Class' and 'CD_Class'. From 'CD_Class', the role 'CD_Class0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CD_Class', the role 'CD_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'CD_Attribute' and 'CD_Class'. From 'CD_Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CD_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'CD_Attribute' and 'CD_Classifier'. From 'CD_Attribute', the role 'CD_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CD_Classifier', the role 'CD_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'CD_Attribute' and 'CD_Class'. From 'CD_Attribute', the role 'attr' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CD_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'CD_Classifier' and 'CD_Package'. From 'CD_Classifier', the role 'CD_Classifier6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CD_Package', the role 'CD_Package' has cardinality 0..*.
