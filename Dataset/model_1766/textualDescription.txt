The domain model 'elements' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'elements_Writer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Person' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'elements_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'elements_Book' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BookCategory' defines the following possible values: 'ScienceFiction', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'IT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'elements_Writer' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'elements_EObject' and 'elements_Book'. From 'elements_EObject', the role 'elements_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'elements_Book', the role 'elements_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'elements_Writer' and 'elements_EObject'. From 'elements_Writer', the role 'elements_Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'elements_EObject', the role 'elements_EObject2' has cardinality 0..*.
