The domain model 'studyprogram' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'studyprogram_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Slot' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'studyprogram_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'credits', which is of type float.

'studyprogram_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'year', which is of type int; 'season', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Season' defines the following possible values: 'Spring', 'Fall', 'Summer'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'studyprogram_Program' and 'studyprogram_Semester'. From 'studyprogram_Program', the role 'studyprogram_Program' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogram_Semester', the role 'studyprogram_Semester' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogram_Specialization' and 'studyprogram_Program'. From 'studyprogram_Specialization', the role 'studyprogram_Specialization' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogram_Program', the role 'studyprogram_Program2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogram_Specialization' and 'studyprogram_Semester'. From 'studyprogram_Specialization', the role 'studyprogram_Specialization4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogram_Semester', the role 'studyprogram_Semester5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogram_Specialization' and 'studyprogram_Specialization'. From 'studyprogram_Specialization', the role 'studyprogram_Specialization6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogram_Specialization', the role 'studyprogram_Specialization8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogram_Slot' and 'studyprogram_Semester'. From 'studyprogram_Slot', the role 'studyprogram_Slot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogram_Semester', the role 'studyprogram_Semester10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogram_Course' and 'studyprogram_Slot'. From 'studyprogram_Course', the role 'studyprogram_Course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogram_Slot', the role 'studyprogram_Slot12' has cardinality 0..*.
