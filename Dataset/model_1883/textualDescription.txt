Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'RoomStatus' defines the following possible values: 'Available', 'Occupied', 'Maintenance', 'Cleaning'.
The enumeration 'ChargeType' defines the following possible values: 'LateCheckOutFee', 'CancellationFee', 'FamilySuite', 'Breakfast', 'SingleRoom', 'DoubleRoom'.
The enumeration 'RoomTypeName' defines the following possible values: 'SingleRoom', 'FamilySuite', 'DoubleRoom'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Classes_Customer' is a specialization of 'IPerson'.
The class 'Classes_IBookingManagementImpl' is a specialization of 'IBookingManagement'.
The class 'Classes_IHotelManagerImpl' is a specialization of 'IHotelManager'.
The class 'Classes_StaffMember' is a specialization of 'IPerson'.
The class 'Classes_IFinanceImpl' is a specialization of 'IFinance'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
