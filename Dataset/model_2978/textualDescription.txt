The domain model 'machine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'machine_Tape' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'machine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'machine_TuringMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'machine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'write', which is of type str; 'moveTo', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'read', which is of type str.

'machine_Machine' represents an important domain concept.

It has the following attributes: 'position', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'machine_Initial' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'machine_Final' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'machine_Head' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'machine_Current' represents an important domain concept.
