Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'robot_robot_ProgramUnit' and 'Expression'. From 'robot_robot_ProgramUnit', the role 'robot_robot_ProgramUnit' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Expression', the role 'Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BoolExp' and 'robot_FlotCtrl_WhileLoop'. From 'BoolExp', the role 'BoolExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_FlotCtrl_WhileLoop', the role 'robot_FlotCtrl_WhileLoop' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Expression' and 'robot_FlotCtrl_WhileLoop'. From 'Expression', the role 'Expression4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_FlotCtrl_WhileLoop', the role 'robot_FlotCtrl_WhileLoop3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_FlotCtrl_NegExp' and 'BoolExp'. From 'robot_FlotCtrl_NegExp', the role 'robot_FlotCtrl_NegExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BoolExp', the role 'BoolExp6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_FlotCtrl_AndExp' and 'BoolExp'. From 'robot_FlotCtrl_AndExp', the role 'robot_FlotCtrl_AndExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BoolExp', the role 'BoolExp8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_FlotCtrl_AndExp' and 'BoolExp'. From 'robot_FlotCtrl_AndExp', the role 'robot_FlotCtrl_AndExp10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BoolExp', the role 'BoolExp11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_FlotCtrl_IfBlock' and 'BoolExp'. From 'robot_FlotCtrl_IfBlock', the role 'robot_FlotCtrl_IfBlock' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BoolExp', the role 'BoolExp13' has cardinality 0..*.
