Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'l3_Component' and 'l3_BuildComponent'. From 'l3_Component', the role 'l3_Component' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'l3_BuildComponent', the role 'l3_BuildComponent' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'l3_Model' and 'l3_Metamodel'. From 'l3_Model', the role 'l3_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'l3_Metamodel', the role 'l3_Metamodel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'l3_SystemModel' and 'l3_Model'. From 'l3_SystemModel', the role 'l3_SystemModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'l3_Model', the role 'l3_Model3' has cardinality 0..*.
