The domain model 'typeB' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'PortB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeB_OutPortB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeB_InPortB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeB_NonReferencedClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeB_PortB' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'typeB_BlockB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeB_NonReferencedClass2' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'typeB_InPortB' is a specialization of 'PortB'.
The class 'typeB_OutPortB' is a specialization of 'PortB'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'typeB_BlockB' and 'typeB_InPortB'. From 'typeB_BlockB', the role 'typeB_BlockB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeB_InPortB', the role 'typeB_InPortB' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'typeB_OutPortB' and 'typeB_BlockB'. From 'typeB_OutPortB', the role 'OutPortB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeB_BlockB', the role 'block' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'typeB_OutPortB' and 'typeB_BlockB'. From 'typeB_OutPortB', the role 'outputPorts' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeB_BlockB', the role 'BlockB' has cardinality 0..*.
