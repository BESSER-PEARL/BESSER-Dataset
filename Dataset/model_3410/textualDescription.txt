The domain model 'people' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'people_Universe' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'people_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'gender', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Gender' defines the following possible values: 'FEMALE', 'MALE'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'people_Person' and 'people_Person'. From 'people_Person', the role 'parents' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'people_Person', the role 'Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'people_Person' and 'people_Person'. From 'people_Person', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'people_Person', the role 'Person4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'people_Person' and 'people_Universe'. From 'people_Person', the role 'people_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'people_Universe', the role 'people_Universe' has cardinality 0..*.
