The domain model 'FaultTree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'FaultTree_FaultTree' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'message', which is of type str; 'faultTreeType', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'FaultTree_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FaultTree_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'computedProbability', which is of type str; 'assignedProbability', which is of type str; 'message', which is of type str; 'subEventLogic', which is of type str; 'referenceCount', which is of type int; 'scale', which is of type str; 'k', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EventType' defines the following possible values: 'Intermediate', 'External', 'Undeveloped', 'Basic'.
The enumeration 'FaultTreeType' defines the following possible values: 'FaultTrace', 'CompositeParts', 'MinimalCutSet', 'FaultTree'.
The enumeration 'LogicOperation' defines the following possible values: 'Or', 'Xor', 'kOf', 'And', 'PriorityAnd', 'kOrmore', 'kOrless'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'FaultTree_FaultTree' and 'FaultTree_Event'. From 'FaultTree_FaultTree', the role 'FaultTree_FaultTree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FaultTree_EObject' and 'FaultTree_FaultTree'. From 'FaultTree_EObject', the role 'FaultTree_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_FaultTree', the role 'FaultTree_FaultTree2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FaultTree_Event' and 'FaultTree_FaultTree'. From 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_FaultTree', the role 'FaultTree_FaultTree4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FaultTree_Event' and 'FaultTree_Event'. From 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FaultTree_EObject' and 'FaultTree_Event'. From 'FaultTree_EObject', the role 'FaultTree_EObject11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FaultTree_Event' and 'FaultTree_EObject'. From 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_EObject', the role 'FaultTree_EObject14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FaultTree_Event' and 'FaultTree_EObject'. From 'FaultTree_Event', the role 'FaultTree_Event16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FaultTree_EObject', the role 'FaultTree_EObject17' has cardinality 0..*.
