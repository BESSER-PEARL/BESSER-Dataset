The domain model 'adl203' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'adl203_Binding' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'adl203_Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'signature', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'adl203_BindingAttributes' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'adl203_Required' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adl203_Provided' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adl203_Content' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'expression', which is of type str; 'language', which is of type str.

'adl203_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'adl203_Required' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adl203_Provided' is a specialization of 'Interface'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'adl203_Component' and 'adl203_Content'. From 'adl203_Component', the role 'adl203_Component' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl203_Content', the role 'adl203_Content' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adl203_Component' and 'adl203_Required'. From 'adl203_Component', the role 'adl203_Component2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl203_Required', the role 'adl203_Required' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adl203_Component' and 'adl203_Provided'. From 'adl203_Component', the role 'adl203_Component4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl203_Provided', the role 'adl203_Provided' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adl203_Component' and 'adl203_Binding'. From 'adl203_Component', the role 'adl203_Component6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl203_Binding', the role 'adl203_Binding' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adl203_Component' and 'adl203_Component'. From 'adl203_Component', the role 'adl203_Component7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl203_Component', the role 'adl203_Component9' has cardinality 0..*.
