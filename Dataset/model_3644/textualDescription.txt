An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Company'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'employees' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Company', the role 'Company' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee10' has cardinality 0..*.
