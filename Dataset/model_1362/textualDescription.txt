Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine103_StateMachineObject' and 'statemachine103_StateMachine'. From 'statemachine103_StateMachineObject', the role 'statemachine103_StateMachineObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine103_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine103_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine103_StateMachine' and 'statemachine103_StateMachineVariable'. From 'statemachine103_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine103_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine103_StateMachineVariable', the role 'statemachine103_StateMachineVariable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine103_State' and 'statemachine103_Transition'. From 'statemachine103_State', the role 'statemachine103_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine103_Transition', the role 'statemachine103_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine103_Transition' and 'statemachine103_State'. From 'statemachine103_Transition', the role 'statemachine103_Transition5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine103_State', the role 'statemachine103_State6' has cardinality 0..*.
