The domain model 'rules' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'rules_Rule' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'rules_RulesLattice' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'source', which is of type str; 'target', which is of type str.

'rules_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'rules_NodeRelation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'relationTgt', which is of type str; 'lowerBound', which is of type int; 'upperBound', which is of type int; 'relation', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rules_Rule' and 'rules_RulesLattice'. From 'rules_Rule', the role 'rules_Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_RulesLattice', the role 'rules_RulesLattice' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_Rule' and 'rules_Rule'. From 'rules_Rule', the role 'Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_Rule', the role 'parents' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_Rule' and 'rules_Rule'. From 'rules_Rule', the role 'Rule5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_Rule', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_Rule' and 'rules_Node'. From 'rules_Rule', the role 'rules_Rule7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_Node', the role 'rules_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
