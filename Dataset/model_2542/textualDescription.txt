The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'content_A' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_B' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_C' is a specialization of 'W'.

The class 'content_E' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_F' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_G' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_H' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_I' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_J' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_M' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_N' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_P' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_Q' is a specialization of 'W'.
The class 'content_R' is a specialization of 'W'.
