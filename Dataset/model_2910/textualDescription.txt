The domain model 'agentDSL' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'agentDSL_Goal' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'agentDSL_Function' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'agentDSL_Task' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'agentDSL_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'agentDSL_JAVAID' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'agentDSL_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'agentDSL_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'many', which is of type bool.

'agentDSL_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'agentDSL_Outcome' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'agentDSL_TypeDef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'agentDSL_TypeDef' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'agentDSL_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'agentDSL_Task' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'agentDSL_Outcome' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'agentDSL_Function' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'agentDSL_Type' and 'agentDSL_Model'. From 'agentDSL_Type', the role 'agentDSL_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'agentDSL_Model', the role 'agentDSL_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'agentDSL_JAVAID' and 'agentDSL_TypeDef'. From 'agentDSL_JAVAID', the role 'agentDSL_JAVAID' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'agentDSL_TypeDef', the role 'agentDSL_TypeDef' has cardinality 0..*.
