The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'statemachine_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_MyFSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statemachine_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statemachine_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_MyFSM'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_MyFSM', the role 'statemachine_MyFSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_MyFSM'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_MyFSM', the role 'statemachine_MyFSM2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_InitialState' and 'statemachine_MyFSM'. From 'statemachine_InitialState', the role 'statemachine_InitialState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_MyFSM', the role 'statemachine_MyFSM4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State10' has cardinality 0..*.
