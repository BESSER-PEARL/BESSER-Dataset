The domain model 'RepresentationGraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'RepresentationGraph_GraphicElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'paletteName', which is of type str; 'color', which is of type str; 'paletteIconPath', which is of type str.

'RepresentationGraph_ContainerElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NodeElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RepresentationGraph_Rhombus' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'width', which is of type str; 'height', which is of type str.

'RepresentationGraph_Circle' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'radius', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement' is a specialization of 'GraphicElement'.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement' is a specialization of 'GraphicElement'.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_IconElement' is a specialization of 'NodeElement'.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_Circle' is a specialization of 'ContainerElement'.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_Rectangle' is a specialization of 'ContainerElement'.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_ContainerElement' is a specialization of 'NodeElement'.
The class 'RepresentationGraph_Rhombus' is a specialization of 'ContainerElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'RepresentationGraph_Diagram' and 'RepresentationGraph_GraphicElement'. From 'RepresentationGraph_Diagram', the role 'RepresentationGraph_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RepresentationGraph_GraphicElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_GraphicElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement' and 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement'. From 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement' and 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement'. From 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_EdgeElement3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement' and 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement'. From 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RepresentationGraph_ContainerElement' and 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement'. From 'RepresentationGraph_ContainerElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_ContainerElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement', the role 'RepresentationGraph_NodeElement9' has cardinality 0..*.
