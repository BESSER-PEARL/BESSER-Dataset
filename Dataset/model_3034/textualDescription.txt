An association connects 'myfsm_Machine' and 'myfsm_State'. From 'myfsm_Machine', the role 'myfsm_Machine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myfsm_State', the role 'myfsm_State3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myfsm_Trans' and 'myfsm_State'. From 'myfsm_Trans', the role 'myfsm_Trans' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myfsm_State', the role 'myfsm_State5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myfsm_Trans' and 'myfsm_State'. From 'myfsm_Trans', the role 'myfsm_Trans7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myfsm_State', the role 'myfsm_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
