'Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mvc_Client' is a specialization of 'Model'.
The class 'mvc_DataBase' is a specialization of 'Model'.
The class 'mvc_GraphicComponent' is a specialization of 'View'.
The class 'mvc_MapComponent' is a specialization of 'View'.
The class 'mvc_SocialComponent' is a specialization of 'View'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mvc_View' and 'mvc_MvcApplication'. From 'mvc_View', the role 'mvc_View' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mvc_MvcApplication', the role 'mvc_MvcApplication' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mvc_MvcApplication' and 'mvc_Model'. From 'mvc_MvcApplication', the role 'mvc_MvcApplication2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mvc_Model', the role 'mvc_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mvc_MvcApplication' and 'mvc_Controller'. From 'mvc_MvcApplication', the role 'mvc_MvcApplication4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mvc_Controller', the role 'mvc_Controller' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mvc_Controller' and 'mvc_Model'. From 'mvc_Controller', the role 'controller' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mvc_Model', the role 'Model' has cardinality 0..*.
