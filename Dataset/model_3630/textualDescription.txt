Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Mode' defines the following possible values: 'KnowsWhoCanTeach', 'CanTeach', 'Both', 'None', 'KnowsWhoCanBoth', 'CanDo', 'KnowsWhoCanDo'.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'Double1', 'String1', 'ServiceAskMode', 'ServiceOfferMode', 'Integer1', 'boolean', 'string', 'Boolean1', 'double', 'integer'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'selflet_ElementaryBehavior' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'selflet_ComplexBehavior' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'selflet_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'selflet_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'selflet_AbilityState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'selflet_IntermediateState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
