The domain model 'company' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'company_Company' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'size', which is of type str.

'company_Employee' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'hasNameAsAttribute', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'CompanySizeKind' defines the following possible values: 'small', 'medium', 'large'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'company_Company' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Company', the role 'company' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'Employee' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Company' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Company', the role 'Company' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'employees' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'company_Employee' and 'company_Employee'. From 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'company_Employee', the role 'company_Employee10' has cardinality 0..*.
