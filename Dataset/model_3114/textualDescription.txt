The domain model 'LedsCodeModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'LedsCodeModel_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'LedsCodeModel_AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'LedsCodeModel_Specification' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'createdDate', which is of type date.

'LedsCodeModel_ENUM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'values', which is of type str.

'LedsCodeModel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'engine', which is of type str; 'dataBaseName', which is of type str; 'orm', which is of type str; 'language', which is of type str; 'applicationType', which is of type str.

'AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'LedsCodeModel_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'stereotypeClass', which is of type str; 'abstract', which is of type bool.

'LedsCodeModel_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'LedsCodeModel_PrimitiveDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'LedsCodeModel_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'LedsCodeModel_ClassDiagram' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'LedsCodeModel_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'StereotypeClass' defines the following possible values: 'View', 'Entity', 'Security'.
The enumeration 'StereotypeAttribute' defines the following possible values: 'Password', 'User'.
The enumeration 'PrimitiveData' defines the following possible values: 'int', 'String', 'long', 'short', 'char', 'byte', 'boolean', 'float', 'double'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'LedsCodeModel_ClassDiagram' is a specialization of 'Model'.
The class 'LedsCodeModel_Class' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.
The class 'LedsCodeModel_PrimitiveDataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'LedsCodeModel_AbstractClass' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'LedsCodeModel_ENUM' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'LedsCodeModel_Model' and 'LedsCodeModel_Specification'. From 'LedsCodeModel_Model', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LedsCodeModel_Specification', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Specification' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'LedsCodeModel_Specification' and 'LedsCodeModel_Feature'. From 'LedsCodeModel_Specification', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Specification2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LedsCodeModel_Feature', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'LedsCodeModel_AbstractClass' and 'LedsCodeModel_ClassDiagram'. From 'LedsCodeModel_AbstractClass', the role 'LedsCodeModel_AbstractClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LedsCodeModel_ClassDiagram', the role 'LedsCodeModel_ClassDiagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'LedsCodeModel_Attribute' and 'LedsCodeModel_Class'. From 'LedsCodeModel_Attribute', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LedsCodeModel_Class', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'LedsCodeModel_Class' and 'LedsCodeModel_Class'. From 'LedsCodeModel_Class', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Class5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LedsCodeModel_Class', the role 'LedsCodeModel_Class7' has cardinality 0..*.
