The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'PetriNetElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'marking', which is of type int.

'petrinet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'multiplicity', which is of type int; 'readOnly', which is of type bool.

'petrinet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_PetriNetElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Node' is a specialization of 'PetriNetElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Arc' is a specialization of 'PetriNetElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNetElement' and 'petrinet_PetriNet'. From 'petrinet_PetriNetElement', the role 'PetriNetElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_PetriNetElement'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_PetriNetElement', the role 'petriNetElements' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'predecessor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Arc' and 'petrinet_Node'. From 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'Arc4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Node', the role 'successor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'linksToSuccessor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'Node7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'linksToPredecessor' has cardinality 0..*.
