The domain model 'featuremodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 21 main class(es).

'featuremodel_AttributeValueString' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

It does not declare any attributes.

'featuremodel_AttributeType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featuremodel_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str; 'setable', which is of type bool.

'featuremodel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VariabilityType' defines the following possible values: 'alternative', 'or', 'mandatory', 'optional'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featuremodel_Constraint' is a specialization of 'Rule'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeTypeInt' is a specialization of 'AttributeType'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeTypeString' is a specialization of 'AttributeType'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeTypeBoolean' is a specialization of 'AttributeType'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeTypeEObject' is a specialization of 'AttributeType'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeValueInt' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeValueString' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeValueBoolean' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.
The class 'featuremodel_AttributeValueEObject' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'featuremodel_FeatureModel' and 'featuremodel_Description'. From 'featuremodel_FeatureModel', the role 'featuremodel_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featuremodel_Description', the role 'featuremodel_Description' has cardinality 0..*.
