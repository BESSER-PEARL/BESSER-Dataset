The domain model 'cfgraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'cfgraph_ControlFlowGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'backward', which is of type bool.

'StatementVertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cfgraph_StatementVertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cfgraph_SimpleStatementVertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cfgraph_StartVertex' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'cfgraph_StartVertex' is a specialization of 'ControlFlowVertex'.
The class 'cfgraph_BodyVertex' is a specialization of 'ControlFlowVertex'.
The class 'cfgraph_EndVertex' is a specialization of 'BodyVertex'.
The class 'cfgraph_StatementVertex' is a specialization of 'BodyVertex'.
The class 'cfgraph_SimpleStatementVertex' is a specialization of 'StatementVertex'.
The class 'cfgraph_CallVertex' is a specialization of 'StatementVertex'.
The class 'cfgraph_BranchingVertex' is a specialization of 'BodyVertex'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'cfgraph_ControlFlowGraph' and 'cfgraph_StartVertex'. From 'cfgraph_ControlFlowGraph', the role 'cfgraph_ControlFlowGraph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cfgraph_StartVertex', the role 'cfgraph_StartVertex' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cfgraph_BodyVertex' and 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge'. From 'cfgraph_BodyVertex', the role 'BodyVertex' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge', the role 'incomingEdges' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cfgraph_StartVertex' and 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge'. From 'cfgraph_StartVertex', the role 'cfgraph_StartVertex3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge', the role 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cfgraph_BodyVertex' and 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge'. From 'cfgraph_BodyVertex', the role 'end' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge', the role 'ControlFlowEdge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cfgraph_StatementVertex' and 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge'. From 'cfgraph_StatementVertex', the role 'cfgraph_StatementVertex' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge', the role 'cfgraph_ControlFlowEdge6' has cardinality 0..*.
