The domain model 'simplestatechart' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'simplestatechart_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'expression', which is of type str.

'simplestatechart_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'label', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'activity', which is of type str.

'simplestatechart_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplestatechart_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'simplestatechart_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'simplestatechart_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplestatechart_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simplestatechart_Variable' is a specialization of 'Thing'.
The class 'simplestatechart_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simplestatechart_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simplestatechart_Thing' and 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo'. From 'simplestatechart_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplestatechart_Thing' and 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo'. From 'simplestatechart_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo' and 'simplestatechart_Thing'. From 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo', the role 'simplestatechart_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplestatechart_Thing', the role 'simplestatechart_Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
