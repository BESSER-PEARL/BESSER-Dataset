The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ktest301_Interface' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ktest301_Binding' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ktest301_Required' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'ktest301_Provided' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'ktest301_Component' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.
The class 'ktest301_Component' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ktest301_Type' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'ktest301_Item' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ktest301_Content' and 'ktest301_AbstractComponent'. From 'ktest301_Content', the role 'ktest301_Content' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest301_AbstractComponent', the role 'ktest301_AbstractComponent' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest301_Attributes' and 'ktest301_AbstractComponent'. From 'ktest301_Attributes', the role 'ktest301_Attributes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest301_AbstractComponent', the role 'ktest301_AbstractComponent2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest301_Required' and 'ktest301_AbstractComponent'. From 'ktest301_Required', the role 'ktest301_Required' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest301_AbstractComponent', the role 'ktest301_AbstractComponent4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest301_AbstractComponent' and 'ktest301_Provided'. From 'ktest301_AbstractComponent', the role 'ktest301_AbstractComponent6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest301_Provided', the role 'ktest301_Provided' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest301_Interface' and 'ktest301_Binding'. From 'ktest301_Interface', the role 'ktest301_Interface' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest301_Binding', the role 'ktest301_Binding' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest301_Binding' and 'ktest301_Interface'. From 'ktest301_Binding', the role 'ktest301_Binding9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest301_Interface', the role 'ktest301_Interface10' has cardinality 0..*.
