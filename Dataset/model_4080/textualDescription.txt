The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation' is a specialization of 'UmlPackageElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlAttribute' is a specialization of 'UmlModelElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlClass' is a specialization of 'UmlClassifier'.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlClassifier' is a specialization of 'UmlPackageElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlPackage' is a specialization of 'UmlModelElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlPackageElement' is a specialization of 'UmlModelElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_UmlPrimitiveDataType' is a specialization of 'UmlClassifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_UmlClass' and 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation'. From 'SimpleUML_UmlClass', the role 'UmlClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation', the role 'umlForward' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_UmlClass' and 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation'. From 'SimpleUML_UmlClass', the role 'UmlClass2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation', the role 'umlReverse' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_UmlAttribute' and 'SimpleUML_UmlClass'. From 'SimpleUML_UmlAttribute', the role 'umlAttribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_UmlClass', the role 'UmlClass4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_UmlAttribute' and 'SimpleUML_UmlClassifier'. From 'SimpleUML_UmlAttribute', the role 'umlAttribute1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_UmlClassifier', the role 'UmlClassifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation' and 'SimpleUML_UmlClass'. From 'SimpleUML_UmlAssociation', the role 'UmlAssociation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_UmlClass', the role 'umlDestination' has cardinality 0..*.
