The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'test_E' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute2', which is of type str.

'test_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

'test_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

'E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

'test_Adown' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'test_Adown' is a specialization of 'E'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_B' and 'test_Adown'. From 'test_B', the role 'test_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Adown', the role 'test_Adown' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_C' and 'test_Adown'. From 'test_C', the role 'C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Adown', the role 'a' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_Adown' and 'test_D'. From 'test_Adown', the role 'test_Adown3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_D', the role 'test_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_C' and 'test_Adown'. From 'test_C', the role 'c' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Adown', the role 'Adown' has cardinality 0..*.
