The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fm_OrFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'fm_XorFeature' is a specialization of 'OrFeature'.
The class 'fm_FeatureCardinality' is a specialization of 'Cardinality'.
The class 'fm_GroupCardinality' is a specialization of 'Cardinality'.
The class 'fm_CardExConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraints'.
The class 'fm_AndOperator' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'fm_OrOperator' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'fm_BooleanConstraints' is a specialization of 'Constraints'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fm_FeatureModel' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_FeatureModel', the role 'fm_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_Constraints' and 'fm_FeatureModel'. From 'fm_Constraints', the role 'fm_Constraints' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_FeatureModel', the role 'fm_FeatureModel2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_Feature' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_FeatureCardinality' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_FeatureCardinality', the role 'fm_FeatureCardinality' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_Feature' and 'fm_Attribute'. From 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Attribute', the role 'fm_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
