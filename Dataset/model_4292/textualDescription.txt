The domain model 'Metrics' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'Metrics_IntegerMetricValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'Metrics_BooleanMetricValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'Metrics_Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'MetricValue' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Metrics_MetricValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tag', which is of type str.

'Metrics_DoubleMetricValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'Metrics_StringMetricValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Metrics_StringMetricValue' is a specialization of 'MetricValue'.
The class 'Metrics_BooleanMetricValue' is a specialization of 'MetricValue'.
The class 'Metrics_IntegerMetricValue' is a specialization of 'MetricValue'.
The class 'Metrics_DoubleMetricValue' is a specialization of 'MetricValue'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Metrics_Metric' and 'MetricValue'. From 'Metrics_Metric', the role 'Metrics_Metric' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetricValue', the role 'MetricValue' has cardinality 0..*.
