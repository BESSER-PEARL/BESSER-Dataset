The domain model 'graphdb' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'graphdb_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphdb_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphdb_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'key', which is of type str.

'graphdb_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphdb_GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphdb_Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'labels', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PrimitiveType' defines the following possible values: 'Integer', 'String', 'Object', 'Boolean'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graphdb_GraphElement' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'graphdb_Vertex' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'graphdb_Edge' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'graphdb_Property' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graphdb_Vertex' and 'graphdb_Graph'. From 'graphdb_Vertex', the role 'Vertex' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Graph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Edge' and 'graphdb_Graph'. From 'graphdb_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Graph', the role 'graph2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_GraphElement' and 'graphdb_Property'. From 'graphdb_GraphElement', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Property', the role 'Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Vertex' and 'graphdb_Edge'. From 'graphdb_Vertex', the role 'head' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Edge', the role 'Edge5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Vertex' and 'graphdb_Edge'. From 'graphdb_Vertex', the role 'tail' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Edge', the role 'Edge7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Graph' and 'graphdb_Vertex'. From 'graphdb_Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Vertex', the role 'vertices' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Vertex' and 'graphdb_Edge'. From 'graphdb_Vertex', the role 'Vertex10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Edge', the role 'outEdges' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Vertex' and 'graphdb_Edge'. From 'graphdb_Vertex', the role 'Vertex12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Edge', the role 'inEdges' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_Graph' and 'graphdb_Edge'. From 'graphdb_Graph', the role 'Graph14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Edge', the role 'edges' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphdb_GraphElement' and 'graphdb_Property'. From 'graphdb_GraphElement', the role 'GraphElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphdb_Property', the role 'properties' has cardinality 0..*.
