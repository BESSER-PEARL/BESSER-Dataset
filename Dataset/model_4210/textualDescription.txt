The class 'myDsl_Greeting' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_Model' and 'myDsl_Element'. From 'myDsl_Model', the role 'myDsl_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Element', the role 'myDsl_Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Person' and 'myDsl_Greeting'. From 'myDsl_Person', the role 'myDsl_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Greeting', the role 'myDsl_Greeting' has cardinality 0..*.
