The domain model 'di' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'di_Point' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Shape' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Style' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'fontStrikeThrough', which is of type str; 'fillOpacity', which is of type str; 'strokeWidth', which is of type str; 'fontUnderline', which is of type str; 'fontSize', which is of type str; 'fontBold', which is of type str; 'fontItalic', which is of type str; 'strokeOpacity', which is of type str; 'fontName', which is of type str; 'strokeDashLength', which is of type str.

'di_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Bounds' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Color' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Fill' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_DiagramElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'di_Shape' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'resolution', which is of type str; 'documentation', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'DiagramElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'di_Edge' is a specialization of 'DiagramElement'.
The class 'di_Diagram' is a specialization of 'Shape'.
The class 'di_Shape' is a specialization of 'DiagramElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'di_DiagramElement' and 'di_DiagramElement'. From 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'DiagramElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'ownedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_DiagramElement' and 'di_DiagramElement'. From 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'owningElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'DiagramElement4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_DiagramElement' and 'di_Style'. From 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'di_DiagramElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Style', the role 'di_Style' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_Style' and 'di_DiagramElement'. From 'di_Style', the role 'di_Style8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'di_DiagramElement7' has cardinality 0..*.
