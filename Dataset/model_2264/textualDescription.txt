An association connects 'university_University' and 'university_Student'. From 'university_University', the role 'university_University2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Student', the role 'university_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Student' and 'university_Course'. From 'university_Student', the role 'Student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Course', the role 'course' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Student' and 'university_Course'. From 'university_Student', the role 'student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Course', the role 'Course' has cardinality 0..*.
