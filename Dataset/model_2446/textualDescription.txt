'fsa_FSA' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'temporalFormula', which is of type str.

'fsa_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsa_State' and 'fsa_FSA'. From 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_Transition' and 'fsa_State'. From 'fsa_Transition', the role 'fsa_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_State' and 'fsa_Transition'. From 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_Transition', the role 'fsa_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_Transition' and 'fsa_FSA'. From 'fsa_Transition', the role 'fsa_Transition8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_State' and 'fsa_FSA'. From 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_FSA' and 'fsa_State'. From 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State14' has cardinality 0..*.
