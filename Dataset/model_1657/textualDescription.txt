The domain model 'ktest400' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'ktest400_Line' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'quant', which is of type int; 'articleAid', which is of type str.

'ktest400_Article' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'aid', which is of type str.

'ktest400_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'ktest400_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ktest400_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ktest400_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ktest400_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ktest400_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ktest400_Line' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ktest400_Article' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ktest400_World' and 'ktest400_Thing'. From 'ktest400_World', the role 'ktest400_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_Thing', the role 'ktest400_Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_Article' and 'ktest400_World'. From 'ktest400_Article', the role 'ktest400_Article' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_World', the role 'ktest400_World2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_RelatedTo' and 'ktest400_Thing'. From 'ktest400_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_Thing' and 'ktest400_Line'. From 'ktest400_Thing', the role 'ktest400_Thing5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_Line', the role 'ktest400_Line' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_Thing' and 'ktest400_RelatedTo'. From 'ktest400_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_Thing' and 'ktest400_RelatedTo'. From 'ktest400_Thing', the role 'ktest400_Thing8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_RelatedTo', the role 'ktest400_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_Line' and 'ktest400_Thing'. From 'ktest400_Line', the role 'ktest400_Line10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_Thing', the role 'ktest400_Thing11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest400_Article' and 'ktest400_Line'. From 'ktest400_Article', the role 'ktest400_Article14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest400_Line', the role 'ktest400_Line13' has cardinality 0..*.
