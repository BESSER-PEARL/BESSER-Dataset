The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_TableContentWithoutValidation' is a specialization of 'TableContent'.
The class 'model_TableContentWithValidation' is a specialization of 'TableContent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_Writer' and 'model_Library'. From 'model_Writer', the role 'Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Library', the role 'library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Library' and 'model_Book'. From 'model_Library', the role 'model_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Book', the role 'model_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Librarian' and 'model_Library'. From 'model_Librarian', the role 'model_Librarian' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Library', the role 'model_Library3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Writer' and 'model_Book'. From 'model_Writer', the role 'writers' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Book', the role 'Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Writer' and 'model_Library'. From 'model_Writer', the role 'writers6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Library', the role 'Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Writer' and 'model_Book'. From 'model_Writer', the role 'Writer8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Book', the role 'books' has cardinality 0..*.
