The domain model 'cbpmni' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'cbpmni_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_ProcessModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_ProcessInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_SplitInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_BranchInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_OCLConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FlowNodeInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_ConstraintInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_FlowNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_ActivityInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_EventInst' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_Branch' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cbpmni_FlowNodeInst' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'status', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FlowNodeStatusType' defines the following possible values: 'INACTIVE', 'COMPLETED', 'RUNNING', 'ABORTED', 'READY'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'cbpmni_ActivityInst' is a specialization of 'FlowNodeInst'.
The class 'cbpmni_EventInst' is a specialization of 'FlowNodeInst'.
The class 'cbpmni_SplitInst' is a specialization of 'FlowNodeInst'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'cbpmni_ProcessModel' and 'cbpmni_ProcessInst'. From 'cbpmni_ProcessModel', the role 'cbpmni_ProcessModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cbpmni_ProcessInst', the role 'cbpmni_ProcessInst' has cardinality 0..*.
