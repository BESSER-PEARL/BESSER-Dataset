The domain model 'db' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'db_DatabaseElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'db_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'db_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'DatabaseElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'db_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isMany', which is of type str.

'db_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'db_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'db_DatabaseElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'db_Table' is a specialization of 'DatabaseElement'.
The class 'db_Column' is a specialization of 'DatabaseElement'.
The class 'db_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'DatabaseElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'db_DatabaseElement' and 'db_Database'. From 'db_DatabaseElement', the role 'DatabaseElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_Database', the role 'database' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_DatabaseElement' and 'db_Database'. From 'db_DatabaseElement', the role 'contents' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_Database', the role 'Database' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_Column' and 'db_Table'. From 'db_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_Table', the role 'table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_Table' and 'db_Column'. From 'db_Table', the role 'db_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_Column', the role 'db_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_Table' and 'db_Column'. From 'db_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_Column', the role 'columns' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_Column' and 'db_ForeignKey'. From 'db_Column', the role 'db_Column6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_ForeignKey', the role 'db_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_Column' and 'db_ForeignKey'. From 'db_Column', the role 'db_Column9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_ForeignKey', the role 'db_ForeignKey8' has cardinality 0..*.
