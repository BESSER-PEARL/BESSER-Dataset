The domain model 'classdiagram' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_Method' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classdiagram_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classdiagram_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Method' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Class' and 'classdiagram_Class'. From 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Class' and 'classdiagram_Class'. From 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'super' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'Class4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Class' and 'classdiagram_Attribute'. From 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Attribute', the role 'classdiagram_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Class' and 'classdiagram_Method'. From 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Method', the role 'classdiagram_Method' has cardinality 0..*.
