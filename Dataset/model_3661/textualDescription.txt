Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Gender' defines the following possible values: 'Male', 'Female'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'employee_SmallProject' is a specialization of 'Project'.
The class 'employee_LargeProject' is a specialization of 'Project'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'employee_Employee' and 'employee_Organization'. From 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Organization', the role 'employee_Organization' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_Project' and 'employee_Organization'. From 'employee_Project', the role 'employee_Project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Organization', the role 'employee_Organization2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_JobTitle' and 'employee_Organization'. From 'employee_JobTitle', the role 'employee_JobTitle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Organization', the role 'employee_Organization4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_Employee' and 'employee_Project'. From 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Project', the role 'employee_Project6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_Employee' and 'employee_PhoneNumber'. From 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_PhoneNumber', the role 'employee_PhoneNumber' has cardinality 0..*.
