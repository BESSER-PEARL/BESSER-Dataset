The domain model 'classm1' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'classm1_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classm1_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'visibility', which is of type str; 'isKey', which is of type bool.

'classm1_CNamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'CNamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Visibility' defines the following possible values: 'private', 'public'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classm1_Class' is a specialization of 'CNamedElement'.
The class 'classm1_Attribute' is a specialization of 'CNamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classm1_Attribute' and 'classm1_Class'. From 'classm1_Attribute', the role 'classm1_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classm1_Class', the role 'classm1_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classm1_Attribute' and 'classm1_Class'. From 'classm1_Attribute', the role 'classm1_Attribute2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classm1_Class', the role 'classm1_Class3' has cardinality 0..*.
