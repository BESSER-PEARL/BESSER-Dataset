The domain model 'javaz' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'javaz_Field' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'transient', which is of type bool; 'volatile', which is of type bool; 'final', which is of type bool; 'visibility', which is of type str; 'static', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str.

'javaz_JavaElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'javaz_Method' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'native', which is of type bool; 'constructor', which is of type bool; 'static', which is of type bool; 'visibility', which is of type str; 'final', which is of type bool; 'abstract', which is of type bool; 'synchronized', which is of type bool.

'javaz_JavaParameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'parameterKind', which is of type str; 'final', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str; 'kind', which is of type str.

'javaz_Javaz' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'javaz_Block' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'content', which is of type str.

'javaz_JavaPackageX' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'needToGenerate', which is of type bool.

'JavaElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'javaz_JavaClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'final', which is of type bool; 'needToGenerate', which is of type bool; 'rewritable', which is of type bool; 'public', which is of type bool; 'kind', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'JavaParameterKind' defines the following possible values: 'INOUT', 'IN', 'OUT', 'RETURN'.
The enumeration 'JavaKind' defines the following possible values: 'CLASS', 'INTERFACE', 'EXCEPTION'.
The enumeration 'JavaVisibilityKind' defines the following possible values: 'PUBLIC', 'PACKAGE', 'PROTECTED', 'PRIVATE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'javaz_Javaz' is a specialization of 'JavaElement'.
The class 'javaz_JavaClass' is a specialization of 'JavaElement'.
The class 'javaz_JavaPackageX' is a specialization of 'JavaElement'.
The class 'javaz_JavaParameter' is a specialization of 'JavaElement'.
The class 'javaz_Method' is a specialization of 'JavaElement'.
The class 'javaz_Field' is a specialization of 'JavaElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'javaz_Javaz' and 'javaz_JavaPackageX'. From 'javaz_Javaz', the role 'javaz_Javaz' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaPackageX', the role 'javaz_JavaPackageX' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_Javaz' and 'javaz_JavaClass'. From 'javaz_Javaz', the role 'javaz_Javaz2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_Method' and 'javaz_JavaClass'. From 'javaz_Method', the role 'javaz_Method' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_Field' and 'javaz_JavaClass'. From 'javaz_Field', the role 'javaz_Field' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_JavaClass' and 'javaz_JavaClass'. From 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_JavaClass' and 'javaz_JavaPackageX'. From 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaPackageX', the role 'javaz_JavaPackageX12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_JavaClass' and 'javaz_JavaClass'. From 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_JavaClass' and 'javaz_JavaClass'. From 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_JavaClass', the role 'javaz_JavaClass16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_JavaParameter' and 'javaz_Method'. From 'javaz_JavaParameter', the role 'javaz_JavaParameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_Method', the role 'javaz_Method20' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'javaz_Block' and 'javaz_Method'. From 'javaz_Block', the role 'javaz_Block' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'javaz_Method', the role 'javaz_Method22' has cardinality 0..*.
