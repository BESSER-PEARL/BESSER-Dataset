The domain model 'stm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'stm_Guard' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stm_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stm_GuardCall' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'parameters', which is of type str.

'stm_SelfEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stm_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stm_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stm_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'stm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
