The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'library_Search' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_AddAuthor' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_ByYear' is a specialization of 'Search'.
The class 'library_ByAuthor' is a specialization of 'Search'.
The class 'library_Lend' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_Add' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_AddUser' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_Remove' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_Return' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_Check' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_Show' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'library_ShowUserAccount' is a specialization of 'Command'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'library_Command' and 'library_Model'. From 'library_Command', the role 'library_Command' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Model', the role 'library_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_AddAuthor' and 'library_Author'. From 'library_AddAuthor', the role 'library_AddAuthor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Author', the role 'library_Author' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Author' and 'library_ByAuthor'. From 'library_Author', the role 'library_Author3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_ByAuthor', the role 'library_ByAuthor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Author' and 'library_Add'. From 'library_Author', the role 'library_Author5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Add', the role 'library_Add' has cardinality 0..*.
