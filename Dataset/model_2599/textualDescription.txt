The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'test_MyMetaClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'enumAttr', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'SubpackageMetaClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_subpackage_SubpackageMetaClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MyEnum' defines the following possible values: 'X', 'Y'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_MyMetaClass' and 'test_MyMetaClass'. From 'test_MyMetaClass', the role 'test_MyMetaClass0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_MyMetaClass', the role 'test_MyMetaClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_MyMetaClass' and 'SubpackageMetaClass'. From 'test_MyMetaClass', the role 'test_MyMetaClass3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SubpackageMetaClass', the role 'SubpackageMetaClass' has cardinality 0..*.
