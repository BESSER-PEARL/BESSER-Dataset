The domain model 'metric' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metric_Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metric_ConstraintMetrics' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'numberOfConstraintsByKind', which is of type str.

'ConstraintMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metric_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metric_ConstraintMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'numberOfIfExpressions', which is of type int; 'expressionDepth', which is of type int; 'usedLiterals', which is of type str; 'expressionCount', which is of type int; 'usedIterators', which is of type str; 'calledProperties', which is of type str; 'numberOfLetExpressions', which is of type int; 'calledOperations', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metric_ConstraintMetrics' is a specialization of 'ConstraintMetric'.
The class 'metric_ConstraintMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'metric_ConstraintMetric' and 'metric_ConstraintMetrics'. From 'metric_ConstraintMetric', the role 'metric_ConstraintMetric' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metric_ConstraintMetrics', the role 'metric_ConstraintMetrics' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metric_ConstraintMetrics' and 'metric_Constraint'. From 'metric_ConstraintMetrics', the role 'metric_ConstraintMetrics2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metric_Constraint', the role 'metric_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metric_ConstraintMetric' and 'metric_Constraint'. From 'metric_ConstraintMetric', the role 'metric_ConstraintMetric4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metric_Constraint', the role 'metric_Constraint5' has cardinality 0..*.
