The domain model 'BKeys' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'BKeys_RootB' represents an important domain concept.

'BKeys_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BKeys_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'BKeys_B' and 'BKeys_RootB'. From 'BKeys_B', the role 'bs' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BKeys_RootB', the role 'RootB' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BKeys_Y' and 'BKeys_B'. From 'BKeys_Y', the role 'Y' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BKeys_B', the role 'b' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BKeys_B' and 'BKeys_RootB'. From 'BKeys_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BKeys_RootB', the role 'root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BKeys_Y' and 'BKeys_RootB'. From 'BKeys_Y', the role 'BKeys_Y' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BKeys_RootB', the role 'BKeys_RootB' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BKeys_B' and 'BKeys_Y'. From 'BKeys_B', the role 'B5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BKeys_Y', the role 'y' has cardinality 0..*.
