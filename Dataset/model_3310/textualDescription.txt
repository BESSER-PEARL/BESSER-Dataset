The domain model 'grammar' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'grammar_LHS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'grammar_Rule' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'priority', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'grammar_Embedding' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'grammar_ConnexionInstruction' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'm', which is of type str.

'grammar_Grammar' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'grammar_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'grammar_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'grammar_RHS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'grammar_Grammar' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'grammar_Rule' and 'grammar_Grammar'. From 'grammar_Rule', the role 'Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammar_Grammar', the role 'parentGrammar' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammar_Grammar' and 'grammar_Rule'. From 'grammar_Grammar', the role 'Grammar' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammar_Rule', the role 'rules' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammar_LHS' and 'grammar_Rule'. From 'grammar_LHS', the role 'LHS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammar_Rule', the role 'parentRule' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammar_RHS' and 'grammar_Rule'. From 'grammar_RHS', the role 'RHS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammar_Rule', the role 'parentRule4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammar_Rule' and 'grammar_Embedding'. From 'grammar_Rule', the role 'ParentRule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammar_Embedding', the role 'Embedding' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammar_LHS' and 'grammar_Rule'. From 'grammar_LHS', the role 'lhs' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammar_Rule', the role 'Rule7' has cardinality 0..*.
