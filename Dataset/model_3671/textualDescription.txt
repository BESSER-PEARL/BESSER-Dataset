Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Demo_Department' and 'Demo_Employee'. From 'Demo_Department', the role 'Department' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Demo_Employee', the role 'WorksIn_employee' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Demo_Employee' and 'Demo_Project'. From 'Demo_Employee', the role 'WorksOn_employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Demo_Project', the role 'Project' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Demo_Employee' and 'Demo_Department'. From 'Demo_Employee', the role 'Employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Demo_Department', the role 'WorksIn_department' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Demo_Department' and 'Demo_Project'. From 'Demo_Department', the role 'Controls_department' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Demo_Project', the role 'Project4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Demo_Employee' and 'Demo_Project'. From 'Demo_Employee', the role 'Employee6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Demo_Project', the role 'WorksOn_project' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Demo_Project' and 'Demo_Department'. From 'Demo_Project', the role 'Controls_project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Demo_Department', the role 'Department8' has cardinality 0..*.
