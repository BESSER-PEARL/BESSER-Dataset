It has the following attributes: 'kindHint', which is of type str; 'periodHint', which is of type str.

'metrics_IdentifierDataKind' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'objectProperty', which is of type str; 'objectKind', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'KindHintType' defines the following possible values: 'BH', 'AVG'.
The enumeration 'ObjectKindType' defines the following possible values: 'EQUIPMENT', 'FUNCTION', 'NODE', 'RELATIONSHIP'.
The enumeration 'ValueKindType' defines the following possible values: 'PERIOD', 'DATETIME', 'METRIC', 'NULL'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metrics_IdentifierDataKind' is a specialization of 'DataKind'.
The class 'metrics_MappingCSV' is a specialization of 'Mapping'.
The class 'metrics_MappingRDBMS' is a specialization of 'Mapping'.
The class 'metrics_MappingRecordXLS' is a specialization of 'MappingRecord'.
The class 'metrics_MappingXLS' is a specialization of 'Mapping'.
The class 'metrics_ValueDataKind' is a specialization of 'DataKind'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'metrics_MappingRecord' and 'metrics_MappingStatistic'. From 'metrics_MappingRecord', the role 'metrics_MappingRecord' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_MappingStatistic', the role 'metrics_MappingStatistic' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metrics_MappingStatistic' and 'metrics_DateTimeRange'. From 'metrics_MappingStatistic', the role 'metrics_MappingStatistic2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_DateTimeRange', the role 'metrics_DateTimeRange' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metrics_MappingXLS' and 'metrics_MappingXLSColumn'. From 'metrics_MappingXLS', the role 'metrics_MappingXLS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_MappingXLSColumn', the role 'metrics_MappingXLSColumn' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metrics_MappingXLSColumn' and 'metrics_DataKind'. From 'metrics_MappingXLSColumn', the role 'metrics_MappingXLSColumn5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_DataKind', the role 'metrics_DataKind' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metrics_Metric' and 'metrics_Metric'. From 'metrics_Metric', the role 'metrics_Metric' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_Metric', the role 'metrics_Metric6' has cardinality 0..*.
