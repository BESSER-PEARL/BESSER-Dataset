The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'smalluml_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_String' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Integer' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Bool' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Real' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_UnlimitedNatural' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Method' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Parameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Relation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Role' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Enumeration' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Enumeration' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Composition' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'smalluml_Reference' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'smalluml_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smalluml_Class' and 'smalluml_Method'. From 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Method', the role 'smalluml_Method' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Attribute' and 'smalluml_Class'. From 'smalluml_Attribute', the role 'smalluml_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Class' and 'smalluml_Class'. From 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Type' and 'smalluml_Attribute'. From 'smalluml_Type', the role 'smalluml_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Attribute', the role 'smalluml_Attribute7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Method' and 'smalluml_Parameter'. From 'smalluml_Method', the role 'smalluml_Method9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Parameter', the role 'smalluml_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Method' and 'smalluml_Type'. From 'smalluml_Method', the role 'smalluml_Method11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Type', the role 'smalluml_Type12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Type' and 'smalluml_Parameter'. From 'smalluml_Type', the role 'smalluml_Type15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Parameter', the role 'smalluml_Parameter14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Role' and 'smalluml_Relation'. From 'smalluml_Role', the role 'smalluml_Role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Relation', the role 'smalluml_Relation' has cardinality 0..*.
