Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'library_UoD' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_UoD', the role 'library_UoD' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_UoD' and 'library_Person'. From 'library_UoD', the role 'library_UoD2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Person', the role 'library_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_UoD' and 'library_Author'. From 'library_UoD', the role 'library_UoD4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Author', the role 'library_Author' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Author' and 'library_Book'. From 'library_Author', the role 'library_Author6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Book', the role 'library_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Book' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Book', the role 'library_Book9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Loan' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Loan', the role 'library_Loan' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Person' and 'library_Loan'. From 'library_Person', the role 'library_Person14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Loan', the role 'library_Loan13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Loan' and 'library_Book'. From 'library_Loan', the role 'library_Loan16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Book', the role 'library_Book17' has cardinality 0..*.
