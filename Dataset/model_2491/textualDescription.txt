The domain model 'z6fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'z6fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'z6fsm_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'z6fsm_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'z6fsm_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'z6fsm_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'z6fsm_Foo' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'z6fsm_AbstractState' and 'z6fsm_Region'. From 'z6fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z6fsm_AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'z6fsm_Region', the role 'z6fsm_Region' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'z6fsm_AbstractState' and 'z6fsm_AbstractState'. From 'z6fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z6fsm_AbstractState1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'z6fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z6fsm_AbstractState3' has cardinality 0..*.
