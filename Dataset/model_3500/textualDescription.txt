The domain model 'sourcecode' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'sourcecode_Assignment' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sourcecode_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Statement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sourcecode_Statement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'sourcecode_Decision' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sourcecode_While' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sourcecode_Assignment' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'sourcecode_Decision' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'sourcecode_While' is a specialization of 'Statement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sourcecode_Statement' and 'sourcecode_Statement'. From 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sourcecode_Decision' and 'sourcecode_Statement'. From 'sourcecode_Decision', the role 'sourcecode_Decision' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sourcecode_Statement' and 'sourcecode_Decision'. From 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sourcecode_Decision', the role 'sourcecode_Decision5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sourcecode_While' and 'sourcecode_Statement'. From 'sourcecode_While', the role 'sourcecode_While' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sourcecode_Statement' and 'sourcecode_While'. From 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sourcecode_While', the role 'sourcecode_While10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sourcecode_Program' and 'sourcecode_Statement'. From 'sourcecode_Program', the role 'sourcecode_Program' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sourcecode_Statement', the role 'sourcecode_Statement13' has cardinality 0..*.
