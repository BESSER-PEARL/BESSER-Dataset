The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str; 'output', which is of type str.

'fsm_FiniteStateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isInitialState', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_FiniteStateMachine' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FiniteStateMachine', the role 'fsm_FiniteStateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
