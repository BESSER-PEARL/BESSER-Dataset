The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Element' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'PetriNet_TransitionToPlace' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNet' and 'Element'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Element', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Arc' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'Arc', the role '#3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Element' and 'PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Element', the role '15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet', the role '#6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'TransitionToPlace'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role '18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TransitionToPlace', the role '#9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PlaceToTransition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role '111' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PlaceToTransition', the role '#12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PlaceToTransition' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PlaceToTransition', the role '#15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role '114' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Transition' and 'TransitionToPlace'. From 'PetriNet_Transition', the role '117' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TransitionToPlace', the role '#18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet', the role '#21' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role '120' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Place' and 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition'. From 'Place', the role '#24' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition', the role '123' has cardinality 0..*.
