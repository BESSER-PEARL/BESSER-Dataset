The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'z5fsm_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'z5fsm_Region' and 'z5fsm_AbstractState'. From 'z5fsm_Region', the role 'z5fsm_Region' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'z5fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z5fsm_AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'z5fsm_AbstractState' and 'z5fsm_AbstractState'. From 'z5fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z5fsm_AbstractState3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'z5fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z5fsm_AbstractState1' has cardinality 0..*.
