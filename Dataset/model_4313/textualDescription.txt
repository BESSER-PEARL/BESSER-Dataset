The domain model 'MetricModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'MetricModel_TaskMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tasksBase', which is of type str.

'MetricModel_ActivityMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'activityBegin', which is of type str; 'activityEnd', which is of type str.

'MetricModel_Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'unit', which is of type str; 'form', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str.

'MetricModel_MetricPlanModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MetricType' defines the following possible values: 'normalizedData', 'softData', 'hardData'.
The enumeration 'ColectType' defines the following possible values: 'intercalated', 'continuous'.
The enumeration 'MetricUnit' defines the following possible values: 'uc', 'minutes'.
The enumeration 'BaseElement' defines the following possible values: 'Activity', 'Task'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'MetricModel_ActivityMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.
The class 'MetricModel_TaskMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'MetricModel_Metric' and 'MetricModel_MetricPlanModel'. From 'MetricModel_Metric', the role 'MetricModel_Metric' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetricModel_MetricPlanModel', the role 'MetricModel_MetricPlanModel' has cardinality 0..*.
