Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ConditionKind' defines the following possible values: 'EQUALS', 'NOT_EQUALS', 'GREATER_THAN', 'LESSER_THAN'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'behaviour_DroneBehaviour' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'behaviour_MoveTo' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_Pause' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_PerformAction' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_Choice' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_WaitForMessage' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_While' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_Instruct' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_Lift' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_PlaceObject' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'behaviour_SendMessage' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
