The domain model 'db' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'db_CustomerReviewType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'comment', which is of type str.

'db_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'db_MovieDBType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'movieDBFeatureMap', which is of type str.

'CriticsReviewType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'db_MovieType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'director', which is of type str; 'summary', which is of type str; 'title', which is of type str; 'any', which is of type str; 'criticsReviewGroup', which is of type str; 'actors', which is of type str; 'iD', which is of type str; 'genre', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'GenreTypes' defines the following possible values: 'Animation', 'Classics', 'Romance', 'Horror', 'Comedy', 'Thriller', 'Documentary', 'NewRelease', 'Action', 'SciFi', 'Family', 'Drama'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'db_CustomerReviewType' is a specialization of 'CriticsReviewType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'db_DocumentRoot' and 'db_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'db_DocumentRoot', the role 'db_DocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'db_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_DocumentRoot' and 'db_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'db_DocumentRoot', the role 'db_DocumentRoot2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'db_EStringToStringMapEntry3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'db_DocumentRoot' and 'db_CustomerType'. From 'db_DocumentRoot', the role 'db_DocumentRoot5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'db_CustomerType', the role 'db_CustomerType' has cardinality 0..*.
