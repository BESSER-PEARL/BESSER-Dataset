Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VersionState' defines the following possible values: 'PLANNED', 'IN_DEVELOPMENT', 'RELEASED'.
The enumeration 'ReleaseType' defines the following possible values: 'nightly', 'release', 'milestone'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'web_HtmlContent' is a specialization of 'Content'.
The class 'web_NewsEntry' is a specialization of 'Container'.
The class 'web_NewsFeedPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'web_ContentPage' is a specialization of 'Container'.
The class 'web_ContentPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'web_ReleaseSection' is a specialization of 'Content'.
The class 'web_GalleryContent' is a specialization of 'Content'.
The class 'web_SocialBar' is a specialization of 'Content'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'web_Page' and 'web_Site'. From 'web_Page', the role 'Page' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'web_Site', the role 'site' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'web_FooterEntry' and 'web_Site'. From 'web_FooterEntry', the role 'web_FooterEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'web_Site', the role 'web_Site' has cardinality 0..*.
