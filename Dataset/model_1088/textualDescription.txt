The domain model 'petriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'petriNet_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'noTokens', which is of type int.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'diagramName', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petriNet_Node' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petriNet_Element' and 'petriNet_PetriNet'. From 'petriNet_Element', the role 'Element' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'diagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_PetriNet' and 'petriNet_Element'. From 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Element', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Place' and 'petriNet_Transition'. From 'petriNet_Place', the role 'petriNet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Transition', the role 'petriNet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Arc' and 'petriNet_Node'. From 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'outgoingArcs' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Node' and 'petriNet_Arc'. From 'petriNet_Node', the role 'Node5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'incomingArcs' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Node' and 'petriNet_Arc'. From 'petriNet_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Node' and 'petriNet_Arc'. From 'petriNet_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc8' has cardinality 0..*.
