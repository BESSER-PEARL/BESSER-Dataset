The domain model 'petri_net' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_net_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petri_net_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_net_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petri_net_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petri_net_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petri_net_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petri_net_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petri_net_PetriNet' and 'petri_net_Node'. From 'petri_net_PetriNet', the role 'petri_net_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_net_Node', the role 'petri_net_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_net_PetriNet' and 'petri_net_Arc'. From 'petri_net_PetriNet', the role 'petri_net_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_net_Arc', the role 'petri_net_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_net_Arc' and 'petri_net_Node'. From 'petri_net_Arc', the role 'petri_net_Arc4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_net_Node', the role 'petri_net_Node5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_net_Node' and 'petri_net_Arc'. From 'petri_net_Node', the role 'petri_net_Node8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_net_Arc', the role 'petri_net_Arc7' has cardinality 0..*.
