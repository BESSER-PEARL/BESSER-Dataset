The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Attribute' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Operation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Operation' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'simple_OO_concept_Behavior' is a specialization of 'Class'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simple_OO_concept_Package' and 'simple_OO_concept_Class'. From 'simple_OO_concept_Package', the role 'simple_OO_concept_Package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simple_OO_concept_Class', the role 'simple_OO_concept_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simple_OO_concept_Package' and 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency'. From 'simple_OO_concept_Package', the role 'simple_OO_concept_Package2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency', the role 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency' and 'simple_OO_concept_NamedElement'. From 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency', the role 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simple_OO_concept_NamedElement', the role 'simple_OO_concept_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simple_OO_concept_Dependency' and 'simple_OO_concept_NamedElement'.
