The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'gedcoml_BekanntePerson' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'gedcoml_PostAddress' is a specialization of 'Address'.
The class 'gedcoml_Others' is a specialization of 'Source'.
The class 'gedcoml_PersonRef' is a specialization of 'Source'.
The class 'gedcoml_UnbekanntePerson' is a specialization of 'Person'.
