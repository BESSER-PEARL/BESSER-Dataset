The domain model 'scribbleTraceDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'Stepdefn' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'scribbleTraceDsl_Stepdefn' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'scribbleTraceDsl_Messagetransfer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'scribbleTraceDsl_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'scribbleTraceDsl_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'roles', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'scribbleTraceDsl_Messagetransfer' is a specialization of 'Stepdefn'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'scribbleTraceDsl_Trace' and 'scribbleTraceDsl_Stepdefn'. From 'scribbleTraceDsl_Trace', the role 'scribbleTraceDsl_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'scribbleTraceDsl_Stepdefn', the role 'scribbleTraceDsl_Stepdefn' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'scribbleTraceDsl_Parameter' and 'scribbleTraceDsl_Messagetransfer'. From 'scribbleTraceDsl_Parameter', the role 'scribbleTraceDsl_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'scribbleTraceDsl_Messagetransfer', the role 'scribbleTraceDsl_Messagetransfer' has cardinality 0..*.
