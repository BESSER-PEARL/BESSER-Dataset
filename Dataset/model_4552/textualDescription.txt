The domain model 'logo' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Command' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'logo_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'logo_Move' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'distance', which is of type float.

'logo_WhileNoObstacle' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'distance', which is of type float.

'logo_ProgramUnit' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'logo_Turn' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'angle', which is of type float.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'logo_Move' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'logo_Turn' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'logo_WhileNoObstacle' is a specialization of 'Command'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'logo_Command' and 'logo_ProgramUnit'. From 'logo_Command', the role 'logo_Command' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'logo_ProgramUnit', the role 'logo_ProgramUnit' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'logo_WhileNoObstacle' and 'logo_Command'. From 'logo_WhileNoObstacle', the role 'logo_WhileNoObstacle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'logo_Command', the role 'logo_Command2' has cardinality 0..*.
