The domain model 'GraphMM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'GraphMM_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'size', which is of type float.

'GraphMM_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'GraphMM_Node' and 'GraphMM_Edge'. From 'GraphMM_Node', the role 'GraphMM_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphMM_Edge', the role 'GraphMM_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphMM_Node' and 'GraphMM_Edge'. From 'GraphMM_Node', the role 'GraphMM_Node3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphMM_Edge', the role 'GraphMM_Edge2' has cardinality 0..*.
