It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_Definition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_NumberLiteral' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_Multi' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_FunctionCall' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rankPL_AbstractDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'rankPL_Minus' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'rankPL_Definition' is a specialization of 'AbstractDefinition'.
The class 'rankPL_DeclaredParameter' is a specialization of 'AbstractDefinition'.
The class 'rankPL_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rankPL_Minus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rankPL_Multi' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rankPL_Div' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rankPL_NumberLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rankPL_FunctionCall' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rankPL_Model' and 'rankPL_AbstractDefinition'. From 'rankPL_Model', the role 'rankPL_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rankPL_AbstractDefinition', the role 'rankPL_AbstractDefinition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rankPL_Definition' and 'rankPL_Expression'. From 'rankPL_Definition', the role 'rankPL_Definition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rankPL_Expression', the role 'rankPL_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rankPL_Plus' and 'rankPL_Expression'. From 'rankPL_Plus', the role 'rankPL_Plus' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rankPL_Expression', the role 'rankPL_Expression3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rankPL_Expression' and 'rankPL_Plus'. From 'rankPL_Expression', the role 'rankPL_Expression6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rankPL_Plus', the role 'rankPL_Plus5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rankPL_Minus' and 'rankPL_Expression'. From 'rankPL_Minus', the role 'rankPL_Minus' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rankPL_Expression', the role 'rankPL_Expression8' has cardinality 0..*.
