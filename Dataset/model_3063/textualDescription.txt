Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'CompositeConditionOperator' defines the following possible values: 'AND', 'OR'.

The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'Integer', 'Date', 'String', 'None', 'Year', 'Boolean', 'Text', 'Email', 'Time'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
