The domain model 'expressions' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 17 main class(es).

'expressions_IntConstant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

The class 'expressions_Comparison' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_IntConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_StringConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_BoolConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_VariableRef' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
