The domain model 'Triangles' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'Triangles_E_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Triangles_D_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Triangles_C_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Triangles_Container' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Triangles_A_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Triangles_B_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Triangles_AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'flag', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Triangles_A_Class' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.
The class 'Triangles_B_Class' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.
The class 'Triangles_C_Class' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.
The class 'Triangles_E_Class' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.
The class 'Triangles_D_Class' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Triangles_Container' and 'Triangles_A_Class'. From 'Triangles_Container', the role 'Triangles_Container' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Triangles_A_Class', the role 'Triangles_A_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Triangles_B_Class' and 'Triangles_Container'. From 'Triangles_B_Class', the role 'Triangles_B_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Triangles_Container', the role 'Triangles_Container2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Triangles_Container' and 'Triangles_C_Class'. From 'Triangles_Container', the role 'Triangles_Container4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Triangles_C_Class', the role 'Triangles_C_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Triangles_Container' and 'Triangles_D_Class'. From 'Triangles_Container', the role 'Triangles_Container6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Triangles_D_Class', the role 'Triangles_D_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Triangles_E_Class' and 'Triangles_Container'. From 'Triangles_E_Class', the role 'Triangles_E_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Triangles_Container', the role 'Triangles_Container8' has cardinality 0..*.
