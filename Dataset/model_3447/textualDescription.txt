The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'test_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'firstame', which is of type str; 'lastname', which is of type str; 'Grade', which is of type str.

'Person' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_University' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'test_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'regNo', which is of type str.

'test_Employee' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'incomeLevel', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EEnum0' is defined but does not specify any literals.
The enumeration 'incomeLevel' defines the following possible values: 'UnderGrad', 'PostDoc', 'PreDoc', 'Professor'.
The enumeration 'Grade' defines the following possible values: 'PHD', 'None', 'MSC', 'BSC', 'Professor'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'test_Student' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'test_Employee' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_Person' and 'test_Person'. From 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_Person' and 'test_Person'. From 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_University' and 'test_Person'. From 'test_University', the role 'test_University' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person6' has cardinality 0..*.
