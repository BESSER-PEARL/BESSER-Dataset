The domain model 'asso' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'asso_VariableRef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_Minus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_NegFloatConstant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type float.

'asso_Plus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_EvalExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_FloatConstant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type float.

'asso_Div' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_Mult' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'asso_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'asso_FloatConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'asso_NegFloatConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'asso_VariableRef' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'asso_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'asso_Minus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'asso_Mult' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'asso_Div' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'asso_Model' and 'asso_Variable'. From 'asso_Model', the role 'asso_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'asso_Variable', the role 'asso_Variable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'asso_EvalExpression' and 'asso_Model'. From 'asso_EvalExpression', the role 'asso_EvalExpression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'asso_Model', the role 'asso_Model2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'asso_Variable' and 'asso_Variable'. From 'asso_Variable', the role 'asso_Variable3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'asso_Variable', the role 'asso_Variable5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'asso_Variable' and 'asso_Expression'. From 'asso_Variable', the role 'asso_Variable7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'asso_Expression', the role 'asso_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
