The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'web_HtmlContent' is a specialization of 'Content'.
The class 'web_NewsEntry' is a specialization of 'Container'.
The class 'web_NewsFeedPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'web_ContentPage' is a specialization of 'Container'.
The class 'web_ContentPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'web_ReleaseSection' is a specialization of 'Content'.
The class 'web_GalleryContent' is a specialization of 'Content'.
The class 'web_SocialBar' is a specialization of 'Content'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
