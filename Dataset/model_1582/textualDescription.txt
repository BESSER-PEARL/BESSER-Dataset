The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'petrinet_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_InputArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'minDelay', which is of type float; 'maxDelay', which is of type float.

'Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_OutputArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Node' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petrinet_Arc' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petrinet_OutputArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petrinet_InputArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Element'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Element', the role 'petrinet_Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_OutputArc' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_OutputArc', the role 'petrinet_OutputArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_OutputArc'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_OutputArc', the role 'petrinet_OutputArc3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_InputArc' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_InputArc', the role 'petrinet_InputArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_InputArc'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_InputArc', the role 'petrinet_InputArc7' has cardinality 0..*.
