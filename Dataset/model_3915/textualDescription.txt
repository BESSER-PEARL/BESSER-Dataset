'entities_Model' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'entities_SimpleType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'entities_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'entities_Model' and 'entities_Type'. From 'entities_Model', the role 'entities_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Type', the role 'entities_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Property'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Property', the role 'entities_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Type' and 'entities_Property'. From 'entities_Type', the role 'entities_Type7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Property', the role 'entities_Property6' has cardinality 0..*.
