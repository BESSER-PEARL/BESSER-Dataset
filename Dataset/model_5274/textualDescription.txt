The domain model 'ecore' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'J' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'foo_J' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'foo_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'fooA', which is of type str.

'B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'foo_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'foo_B' is a specialization of 'J'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'B' and 'foo_A'. From 'B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'foo_A', the role 'foo_A' has cardinality 0..*.
