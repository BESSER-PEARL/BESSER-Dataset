The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'visited', which is of type bool; 'EdgeLabel', which is of type int.

'Identifiable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Identifiable' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'ID', which is of type str; 'number', which is of type int.

'graph_GraphAsset' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Encrypted', which is of type bool; 'Label', which is of type int.

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'Attacker', which is of type bool; 'AttackerObservation', which is of type int; 'visited', which is of type bool.

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Subgraphs' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_NodeResponsibility' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'operation', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graph_Edge' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'graph_GraphAsset' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'graph_Node' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'graph_Subgraphs' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'graph_NodeResponsibility' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_GraphAsset'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_GraphAsset', the role 'graph_GraphAsset' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_GraphAsset' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_GraphAsset', the role 'graph_GraphAsset7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_GraphAsset' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_GraphAsset', the role 'graph_GraphAsset10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node11' has cardinality 0..*.
