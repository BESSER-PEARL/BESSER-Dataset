The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinetmodel_EdgeToPlace' is a specialization of 'Edge'.
The class 'petrinetmodel_EdgeToTransaction' is a specialization of 'Edge'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinetmodel_Petrinet' and 'petrinetmodel_Transition'. From 'petrinetmodel_Petrinet', the role 'petrinetmodel_Petrinet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinetmodel_Transition', the role 'petrinetmodel_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
