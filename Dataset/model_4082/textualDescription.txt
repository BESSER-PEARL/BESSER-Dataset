The domain model 'simpleUML' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'simpleUML_UMLAttribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'umlName', which is of type str.

'simpleUML_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleUML_UMLClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'umlName', which is of type str.

'simpleUML_Generalization' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpleUML_UMLClass' and 'simpleUML_Model'. From 'simpleUML_UMLClass', the role 'simpleUML_UMLClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleUML_Model', the role 'simpleUML_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleUML_UMLClass' and 'simpleUML_UMLClass'. From 'simpleUML_UMLClass', the role 'simpleUML_UMLClass3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleUML_UMLClass', the role 'simpleUML_UMLClass1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleUML_UMLClass' and 'simpleUML_Generalization'. From 'simpleUML_UMLClass', the role 'simpleUML_UMLClass5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleUML_Generalization', the role 'simpleUML_Generalization' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleUML_UMLClass' and 'simpleUML_UMLAttribute'. From 'simpleUML_UMLClass', the role 'simpleUML_UMLClass7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleUML_UMLAttribute', the role 'simpleUML_UMLAttribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleUML_UMLClass' and 'simpleUML_Generalization'. From 'simpleUML_UMLClass', the role 'simpleUML_UMLClass10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleUML_Generalization', the role 'simpleUML_Generalization9' has cardinality 0..*.
