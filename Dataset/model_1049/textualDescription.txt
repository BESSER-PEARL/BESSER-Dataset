It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'efsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'efsm_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'efsm_Param' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'argName', which is of type str; 'argType', which is of type str.

'efsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.

It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'efsm_Input' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'efsm_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'class', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'efsm_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'efsm_InitialState' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'efsm_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'efsm_EFSM' and 'efsm_Transition'. From 'efsm_EFSM', the role 'efsm_EFSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'efsm_Transition', the role 'efsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'efsm_InitialState' and 'efsm_EFSM'. From 'efsm_InitialState', the role 'efsm_InitialState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'efsm_EFSM', the role 'efsm_EFSM2' has cardinality 0..*.
