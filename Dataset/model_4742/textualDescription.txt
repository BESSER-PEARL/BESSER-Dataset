Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SWMLTypes' defines the following possible values: 'Integer', 'Email', 'Float', 'Boolean', 'String'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'swml_v2_IndexPage' is a specialization of 'DynamicPage'.
The class 'swml_v2_DetailsPage' is a specialization of 'DynamicPage'.
The class 'swml_v2_DynamicPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'swml_v2_StaticPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'swml_v2_NCLink' is a specialization of 'Link'.
The class 'swml_v2_CLink' is a specialization of 'Link'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'swml_v2_WebModel' and 'swml_v2_NavigationLayer'. From 'swml_v2_WebModel', the role 'swml_v2_WebModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'swml_v2_NavigationLayer', the role 'swml_v2_NavigationLayer' has cardinality 0..*.
