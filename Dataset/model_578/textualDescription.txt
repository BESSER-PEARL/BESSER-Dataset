The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'AssistantMVC_Exam' is a specialization of 'Observable'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_ExamItem' is a specialization of 'Observable'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_Open' is a specialization of 'ExamItem'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_MultipleChoice' is a specialization of 'ExamItem'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_Controller' is a specialization of 'Observer'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_View' is a specialization of 'Observer'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_ExamController' is a specialization of 'Controller'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_ExamItemController' is a specialization of 'Controller'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_MultipleChoiceController' is a specialization of 'ExamItemController'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_OpenController' is a specialization of 'ExamItemController'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_ExamView' is a specialization of 'View'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_ExamItemView' is a specialization of 'View'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_OpenView' is a specialization of 'ExamView'.
The class 'AssistantMVC_MultipleChoiceView' is a specialization of 'ExamItemView'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'AssistantMVC_ExamItem' and 'AssistantMVC_Exam'. From 'AssistantMVC_ExamItem', the role 'AssistantMVC_ExamItem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AssistantMVC_Exam', the role 'AssistantMVC_Exam' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'AssistantMVC_Exam' and 'AssistantMVC_Controller'. From 'AssistantMVC_Exam', the role 'AssistantMVC_Exam2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AssistantMVC_Controller', the role 'AssistantMVC_Controller' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'AssistantMVC_View' and 'AssistantMVC_Exam'. From 'AssistantMVC_View', the role 'AssistantMVC_View' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AssistantMVC_Exam', the role 'AssistantMVC_Exam4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'AssistantMVC_Observable' and 'AssistantMVC_Observer'. From 'AssistantMVC_Observable', the role 'AssistantMVC_Observable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AssistantMVC_Observer', the role 'AssistantMVC_Observer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'AssistantMVC_Controller' and 'AssistantMVC_View'. From 'AssistantMVC_Controller', the role 'AssistantMVC_Controller8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AssistantMVC_View', the role 'AssistantMVC_View7' has cardinality 0..*.
