The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'trace_GenLinkTrace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_AbstractTrace' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'processed', which is of type bool; 'visualID', which is of type int.

'trace_GenLinkLabelTrace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_MatchingTrace' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'queryText', which is of type str.

'trace_GenChildNodeTrace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_GenNodeTrace' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trace_MatchingTrace' is a specialization of 'AbstractTrace'.
The class 'trace_GenNodeTrace' is a specialization of 'MatchingTrace'.
The class 'trace_GenChildNodeTrace' is a specialization of 'GenNodeTrace'.
The class 'trace_GenNodeLabelTrace' is a specialization of 'MatchingTrace'.
The class 'trace_GenLinkTrace' is a specialization of 'MatchingTrace'.
The class 'trace_GenCompartmentTrace' is a specialization of 'MatchingTrace'.
The class 'trace_GenLinkLabelTrace' is a specialization of 'MatchingTrace'.
The class 'trace_ToolGroupTrace' is a specialization of 'MatchingTrace'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_GenNodeTrace' and 'trace_TraceModel'. From 'trace_GenNodeTrace', the role 'trace_GenNodeTrace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_TraceModel', the role 'trace_TraceModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_TraceModel' and 'trace_GenChildNodeTrace'. From 'trace_TraceModel', the role 'trace_TraceModel2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_GenChildNodeTrace', the role 'trace_GenChildNodeTrace' has cardinality 0..*.
