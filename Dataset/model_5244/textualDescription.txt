The domain model 'surveillance' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'ProbableElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'surveillance_MovingObject' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'angle', which is of type float; 'width', which is of type float; 'speed', which is of type float.

'MovingObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'surveillance_Drone' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'surveillance_ProbableElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'confidence', which is of type float.

'surveillance_Coordinate' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'y', which is of type float; 'x', which is of type float.

'surveillance_GunShot' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'hitsTarget', which is of type bool; 'angle', which is of type float.

'surveillance_Clock' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'now', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'surveillance_Drone' is a specialization of 'MovingObject'.
The class 'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject' is a specialization of 'MovingObject'.
The class 'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject' is a specialization of 'ProbableElement'.
The class 'surveillance_GunShot' is a specialization of 'ProbableElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'surveillance_Coordinate' and 'surveillance_GunShot'. From 'surveillance_Coordinate', the role 'shootingPosition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_GunShot', the role 'GunShot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_Coordinate' and 'surveillance_MovingObject'. From 'surveillance_Coordinate', the role 'currentPosition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_MovingObject', the role 'MovingObject' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_MovingObject' and 'surveillance_Coordinate'. From 'surveillance_MovingObject', the role 'object' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_Coordinate', the role 'Coordinate' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_Drone' and 'surveillance_GunShot'. From 'surveillance_Drone', the role 'drone' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_GunShot', the role 'GunShot4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject' and 'surveillance_GunShot'. From 'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_GunShot', the role 'GunShot6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_GunShot' and 'surveillance_Coordinate'. From 'surveillance_GunShot', the role 'shot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_Coordinate', the role 'Coordinate8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_Drone' and 'surveillance_GunShot'. From 'surveillance_Drone', the role 'Drone' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_GunShot', the role 'shot10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject' and 'surveillance_GunShot'. From 'surveillance_UnidentifiedObject', the role 'UnidentifiedObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'surveillance_GunShot', the role 'shot12' has cardinality 0..*.
