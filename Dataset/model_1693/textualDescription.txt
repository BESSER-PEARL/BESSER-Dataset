The domain model 'helloworld' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'helloworld_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'helloworld_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'helloworld_World' and 'helloworld_Thing'. From 'helloworld_World', the role 'helloworld_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld_Thing', the role 'helloworld_Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld_Thing' and 'helloworld_Thing'. From 'helloworld_Thing', the role 'helloworld_Thing3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld_Thing', the role 'helloworld_Thing1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld_Thing' and 'helloworld_Thing'. From 'helloworld_Thing', the role 'helloworld_Thing6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld_Thing', the role 'helloworld_Thing4' has cardinality 0..*.
