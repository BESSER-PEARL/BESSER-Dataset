The domain model 'toe' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'AllBase' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'toe_Employee' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'salary', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'toe_AllBase' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'toe_AllHolder' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Employee' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'toe_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'toe_Project' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'departmentWide', which is of type bool.

'toe_Contribution' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

'toe_Manager' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'toe_Employee' is a specialization of 'AllBase'.
The class 'toe_Manager' is a specialization of 'Employee'.
The class 'toe_Contribution' is a specialization of 'AllBase'.
The class 'toe_Department' is a specialization of 'AllBase'.
The class 'toe_Project' is a specialization of 'AllBase'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'toe_AllHolder' and 'toe_AllBase'. From 'toe_AllHolder', the role 'toe_AllHolder' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'toe_AllBase', the role 'toe_AllBase' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'toe_Project' and 'toe_Employee'. From 'toe_Project', the role 'Project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'toe_Employee', the role 'projectTeam' has cardinality 0..*.
