The domain model 'dbDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'dbDsl_AbstractDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dbDsl_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'dbDsl_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'AbstractDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dbDsl_AbstractColumnMapper' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dbDsl_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Root' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dbDsl_CharType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dbDsl_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'dbDsl_NumberType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dbDsl_Database' is a specialization of 'Root'.
The class 'dbDsl_CharType' is a specialization of 'AbstractDataType'.
The class 'dbDsl_NumberType' is a specialization of 'AbstractDataType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dbDsl_Table' and 'dbDsl_Database'. From 'dbDsl_Table', the role 'dbDsl_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dbDsl_Database', the role 'dbDsl_Database' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dbDsl_Table' and 'dbDsl_Column'. From 'dbDsl_Table', the role 'dbDsl_Table2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dbDsl_Column', the role 'dbDsl_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dbDsl_AbstractDataType' and 'dbDsl_Column'. From 'dbDsl_AbstractDataType', the role 'dbDsl_AbstractDataType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dbDsl_Column', the role 'dbDsl_Column4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dbDsl_AbstractColumnMapper' and 'dbDsl_Column'. From 'dbDsl_AbstractColumnMapper', the role 'dbDsl_AbstractColumnMapper' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dbDsl_Column', the role 'dbDsl_Column6' has cardinality 0..*.
