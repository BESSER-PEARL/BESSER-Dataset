The domain model 'mydsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'mydsl_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'content', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'isInvisible', which is of type bool.

'mydsl_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'parsed_source', which is of type str; 'label', which is of type str; 'parsed_target', which is of type str.

'mydsl_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mydsl_Graph' and 'mydsl_Edge'. From 'mydsl_Graph', the role 'mydsl_Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mydsl_Edge', the role 'mydsl_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mydsl_Node' and 'mydsl_Graph'. From 'mydsl_Node', the role 'mydsl_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mydsl_Graph', the role 'mydsl_Graph2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mydsl_Graph' and 'mydsl_Graph'. From 'mydsl_Graph', the role 'mydsl_Graph3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mydsl_Graph', the role 'mydsl_Graph5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mydsl_Edge' and 'mydsl_Node'. From 'mydsl_Edge', the role 'mydsl_Edge7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mydsl_Node', the role 'mydsl_Node8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mydsl_Edge' and 'mydsl_Node'. From 'mydsl_Edge', the role 'mydsl_Edge10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mydsl_Node', the role 'mydsl_Node11' has cardinality 0..*.
