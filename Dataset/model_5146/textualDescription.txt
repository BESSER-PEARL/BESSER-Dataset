The domain model 'g' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'g_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'y', which is of type bool.

'g_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'a', which is of type str.

'g_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'x', which is of type str.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'g_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'z', which is of type str.

'g_X' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'g_C' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'g_A' and 'g_B'. From 'g_A', the role 'g_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'g_B', the role 'g_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'g_B' and 'g_B'. From 'g_B', the role 'g_B1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'g_B', the role 'g_B3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'g_X' and 'g_Y'. From 'g_X', the role 'g_X' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'g_Y', the role 'g_Y' has cardinality 0..*.
