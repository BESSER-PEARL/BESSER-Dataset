The domain model 'myDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'myDsl_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Greeting' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Greeting' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'myDsl_Define' represents an important domain concept.

'myDsl_Expressao' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDsl_Selecao' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl_Expressao' is a specialization of 'Greeting'.
The class 'myDsl_Selecao' is a specialization of 'Greeting'.
The class 'myDsl_Define' is a specialization of 'Greeting'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_Model' and 'myDsl_Greeting'. From 'myDsl_Model', the role 'myDsl_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Greeting', the role 'myDsl_Greeting' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Expressao' and 'myDsl_Greeting'. From 'myDsl_Expressao', the role 'myDsl_Expressao' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Greeting', the role 'myDsl_Greeting2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Selecao' and 'myDsl_Define'. From 'myDsl_Selecao', the role 'myDsl_Selecao' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Define', the role 'myDsl_Define' has cardinality 0..*.
