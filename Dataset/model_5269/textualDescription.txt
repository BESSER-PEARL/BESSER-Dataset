The domain model 'testup' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testup_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

'AUp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testup_AUp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testup_E' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

'testup_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newAttribute', which is of type str.

'testup_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testup_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'testup_E' is a specialization of 'AUp'.
The class 'testup_F' is a specialization of 'E'.
The class 'testup_F' is a specialization of 'G'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testup_AUp' and 'testup_B'. From 'testup_AUp', the role 'testup_AUp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testup_B', the role 'testup_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testup_AUp' and 'testup_D'. From 'testup_AUp', the role 'testup_AUp2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testup_D', the role 'testup_D' has cardinality 0..*.
