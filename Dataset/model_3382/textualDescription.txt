The domain model 'errors' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'errors_Ck' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_CheckError' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'porcent', which is of type str.

'errors_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Error' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_Fk' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_Errores' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_ForeignError' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'porcent', which is of type str.

'errors_Registry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_Error' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'apply', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'errors_ForeignError' is a specialization of 'Error'.
The class 'errors_CheckError' is a specialization of 'Error'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'errors_Error' and 'errors_Errores'. From 'errors_Error', the role 'errors_Error' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Errores', the role 'errors_Errores' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ForeignError' and 'errors_Table'. From 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Table', the role 'errors_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ForeignError' and 'errors_Table'. From 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Table', the role 'errors_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ForeignError' and 'errors_Column'. From 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Column', the role 'errors_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ForeignError' and 'errors_Fk'. From 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Fk', the role 'errors_Fk' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_Registry' and 'errors_ForeignError'. From 'errors_Registry', the role 'errors_Registry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_CheckError' and 'errors_Ck'. From 'errors_CheckError', the role 'errors_CheckError' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Ck', the role 'errors_Ck' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_CheckError' and 'errors_Table'. From 'errors_CheckError', the role 'errors_CheckError13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Table', the role 'errors_Table14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_Registry' and 'errors_CheckError'. From 'errors_Registry', the role 'errors_Registry17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_CheckError', the role 'errors_CheckError16' has cardinality 0..*.
