The domain model 'egraphs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'egraphs_EGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'egraphs_ENode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'element', which is of type str.

'egraphs_EHyperEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'egraphs_EGraph' and 'egraphs_ENode'. From 'egraphs_EGraph', the role 'egraphs_EGraph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egraphs_ENode', the role 'egraphs_ENode' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egraphs_ENode' and 'egraphs_EHyperEdge'. From 'egraphs_ENode', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egraphs_EHyperEdge', the role 'EHyperEdge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egraphs_ENode' and 'egraphs_EHyperEdge'. From 'egraphs_ENode', the role 'targets' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egraphs_EHyperEdge', the role 'EHyperEdge3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egraphs_ENode' and 'egraphs_EHyperEdge'. From 'egraphs_ENode', the role 'ENode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egraphs_EHyperEdge', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egraphs_ENode' and 'egraphs_EHyperEdge'. From 'egraphs_ENode', the role 'ENode6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egraphs_EHyperEdge', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*.
