The domain model 'fml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'fml_SelectionItem' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Text', which is of type str; 'selected', which is of type bool; 'preselected', which is of type bool.

'fml_ListItem' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Text', which is of type str.

'fml_InputElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isMandatory', which is of type bool.

'fml_Form' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fml_SelectField' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Type', which is of type str; 'Label', which is of type str.

'fml_PageElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ID', which is of type str.

'fml_List' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isOrdered', which is of type bool.

'fml_DisplayElement' represents an important domain concept.

'fml_TextInput' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Content', which is of type str; 'Label', which is of type str; 'Type', which is of type str.

'fml_TextParagraph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Text', which is of type str.

'PageElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TextInputType' defines the following possible values: 'TEXTAREA', 'TEXTFIELD', 'ENCRYPTED_TEXTFIELD'.
The enumeration 'SelectionType' defines the following possible values: 'CHECKBOX', 'COMBOBOX', 'RADIO'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fml_DisplayElement' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'fml_Heading' is a specialization of 'DisplayElement'.
The class 'fml_TextParagraph' is a specialization of 'DisplayElement'.
The class 'fml_List' is a specialization of 'DisplayElement'.
The class 'fml_InputElement' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'fml_TextInput' is a specialization of 'InputElement'.
The class 'fml_SelectField' is a specialization of 'InputElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fml_Form' and 'fml_Page'. From 'fml_Form', the role 'fml_Form' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_Page', the role 'fml_Page' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_Page' and 'fml_Page'. From 'fml_Page', the role 'fml_Page3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_Page', the role 'fml_Page1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_PageElement' and 'fml_Page'. From 'fml_PageElement', the role 'PageElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_Page', the role 'contained' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_PageElement' and 'fml_Page'. From 'fml_PageElement', the role 'consists' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_Page', the role 'Page' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_SelectionItem' and 'fml_PageElement'. From 'fml_SelectionItem', the role 'SelectionItem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_PageElement', the role 'displayElementVisible' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_ListItem' and 'fml_List'. From 'fml_ListItem', the role 'fml_ListItem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_List', the role 'fml_List' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_SelectField' and 'fml_SelectionItem'. From 'fml_SelectField', the role 'contained9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_SelectionItem', the role 'SelectionItem10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_SelectField' and 'fml_SelectionItem'. From 'fml_SelectField', the role 'SelectField' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_SelectionItem', the role 'consists12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fml_PageElement' and 'fml_SelectionItem'. From 'fml_PageElement', the role 'PageElement14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fml_SelectionItem', the role 'visibleIfSelected' has cardinality 0..*.
