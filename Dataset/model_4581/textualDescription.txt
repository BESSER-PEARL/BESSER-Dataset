Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sparrow_Try' and 'sparrow_Process'. From 'sparrow_Try', the role 'sparrow_Try' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sparrow_Process', the role 'sparrow_Process' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sparrow_Catch' and 'sparrow_Process'. From 'sparrow_Catch', the role 'sparrow_Catch' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sparrow_Process', the role 'sparrow_Process2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sparrow_Finally' and 'sparrow_Process'. From 'sparrow_Finally', the role 'sparrow_Finally' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sparrow_Process', the role 'sparrow_Process4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sparrow_Try' and 'sparrow_Action'. From 'sparrow_Try', the role 'sparrow_Try6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sparrow_Action', the role 'sparrow_Action' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sparrow_Action' and 'sparrow_Finally'. From 'sparrow_Action', the role 'sparrow_Action9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sparrow_Finally', the role 'sparrow_Finally8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sparrow_Action' and 'sparrow_Catch'. From 'sparrow_Action', the role 'sparrow_Action12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sparrow_Catch', the role 'sparrow_Catch11' has cardinality 0..*.
