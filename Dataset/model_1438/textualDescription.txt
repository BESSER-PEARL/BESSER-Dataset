The domain model 'mention_graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'mention_graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'mention_graph_HashTag' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'count', which is of type int.

'mention_graph_MentionGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mention_graph_User' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mention_graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mention_graph_User' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'mention_graph_HashTag' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mention_graph_Node' and 'mention_graph_MentionGraph'. From 'mention_graph_Node', the role 'mention_graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mention_graph_MentionGraph', the role 'mention_graph_MentionGraph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mention_graph_MentionGraph' and 'mention_graph_Edge'. From 'mention_graph_MentionGraph', the role 'mention_graph_MentionGraph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mention_graph_Edge', the role 'mention_graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mention_graph_User' and 'mention_graph_HashTag'. From 'mention_graph_User', the role 'mention_graph_User' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mention_graph_HashTag', the role 'mention_graph_HashTag' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mention_graph_Edge' and 'mention_graph_Node'. From 'mention_graph_Edge', the role 'mention_graph_Edge5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mention_graph_Node', the role 'mention_graph_Node6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mention_graph_Node' and 'mention_graph_Edge'. From 'mention_graph_Node', the role 'mention_graph_Node9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mention_graph_Edge', the role 'mention_graph_Edge8' has cardinality 0..*.
