The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'TypeGraphBasic_TFieldDefinition' is a specialization of 'TMember'.
The class 'TypeGraphBasic_TFieldSignature' is a specialization of 'TSignature'.
The class 'TypeGraphBasic_TMethodDefinition' is a specialization of 'TMember'.
The class 'TypeGraphBasic_TMethodSignature' is a specialization of 'TSignature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
