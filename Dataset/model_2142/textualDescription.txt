The domain model 'WT' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 18 main class(es).

'WT_WTComponents' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'DocumentElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'WT_DocumentElt' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'WT_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'WT_Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Port' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'WT_Vertex' is a specialization of 'DocumentElt'.
The class 'WT_Edge' is a specialization of 'DocumentElt'.
The class 'WT_InitialState' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'WT_SimpleState' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'WT_InPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'WT_OutPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'WT_Subsystem' and 'WT_WTComponents'. From 'WT_Subsystem', the role 'WT_Subsystem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'WT_WTComponents', the role 'WT_WTComponents' has cardinality 0..*.
