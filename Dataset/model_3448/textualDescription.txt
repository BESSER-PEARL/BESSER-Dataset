The domain model 'fopramodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'fopramodel_FoPra' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'maxNumberOfStudents', which is of type int; 'start', which is of type date; 'status', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'end', which is of type date; 'title', which is of type str.

'fopramodel_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'course', which is of type str; 'matrikel', which is of type str.

'fopramodel_ResearchGroup' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fopramodel_ExternalAdvisor' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'information', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Status' defines the following possible values: 'completed', 'pending', 'inprocess', 'cancelled'.
The enumeration 'Course' defines the following possible values: 'InfoPostGraduate', 'InfoBSc', 'InfoDiplom', 'InfoMinorSubject', 'InfoMSc'.
The enumeration 'AuxiliaryKind' defines the following possible values: 'Method', 'Tool', 'ProgrammingLanguage'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fopramodel_Student' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'fopramodel_Professor' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'fopramodel_Associate' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'fopramodel_ExternalAdvisor' is a specialization of 'Person'.
