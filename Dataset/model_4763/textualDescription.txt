The domain model 'itemflow101' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'itemflow101_Port' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'itemflow101_InputPort' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ProcessNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'itemflow101_Description' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'content', which is of type str.

'itemflow101_ProcessNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'itemflow101_Item' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'itemflow101_Function' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'itemflow101_OutputPort' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Port' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'itemflow101_Flow' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'itemflow101_Function' is a specialization of 'ProcessNode'.
The class 'itemflow101_Flow' is a specialization of 'ProcessNode'.
The class 'itemflow101_OutputPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'itemflow101_InputPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'itemflow101_Flow' and 'itemflow101_Function'. From 'itemflow101_Flow', the role 'itemflow101_Flow' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'itemflow101_Function', the role 'itemflow101_Function' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'itemflow101_Function' and 'itemflow101_Function'. From 'itemflow101_Function', the role 'itemflow101_Function1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'itemflow101_Function', the role 'itemflow101_Function3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'itemflow101_Function' and 'itemflow101_OutputPort'. From 'itemflow101_Function', the role 'itemflow101_Function5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'itemflow101_OutputPort', the role 'itemflow101_OutputPort' has cardinality 0..*.
