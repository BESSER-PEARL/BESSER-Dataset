The domain model 'tree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'tree_Data' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tree_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'Node4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Data' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Data', the role 'Data' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Data'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'Node9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Data', the role 'data' has cardinality 0..*.
