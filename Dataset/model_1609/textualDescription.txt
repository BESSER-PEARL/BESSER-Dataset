The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'petrinet_Net' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_Net' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_Net', the role 'cnet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Net' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_Net', the role 'cnet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Transition' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'Transition4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'prep' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'postp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'Transition6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_Net'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'places' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Net', the role 'Net' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'Place9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'postt' has cardinality 0..*.
