The domain model 'smartHome' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'smartHome_Duration' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'unit', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type int.

'smartHome_Location' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'smartHome_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str; 'dataFile', which is of type str.

'smartHome_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

'smartHome_SensorValue' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'smartHome_SensorType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'smartHome_SmartHome' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'smartHome_Rule' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'smartHome_Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'operand', which is of type int; 'operator', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Operator' defines the following possible values: 'INFERIOR', 'EQUALS', 'SUPERIOR'.
The enumeration 'DurationUnit' defines the following possible values: 'SECOND', 'MINUTE'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smartHome_Sensor' and 'smartHome_SensorType'. From 'smartHome_Sensor', the role 'smartHome_Sensor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_SensorType', the role 'smartHome_SensorType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_Location' and 'smartHome_Sensor'. From 'smartHome_Location', the role 'smartHome_Location' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_Sensor', the role 'smartHome_Sensor2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_Location' and 'smartHome_SmartHome'. From 'smartHome_Location', the role 'smartHome_Location4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_SmartHome', the role 'smartHome_SmartHome' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_SmartHome' and 'smartHome_SensorType'. From 'smartHome_SmartHome', the role 'smartHome_SmartHome6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_SensorType', the role 'smartHome_SensorType7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_Rule' and 'smartHome_SmartHome'. From 'smartHome_Rule', the role 'smartHome_Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_SmartHome', the role 'smartHome_SmartHome9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_Condition' and 'smartHome_Rule'. From 'smartHome_Condition', the role 'smartHome_Condition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_Rule', the role 'smartHome_Rule11' has cardinality 0..*.
