The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mission_Mission' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mission_Drone' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mission_Task' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mission_ControlTask' is a specialization of 'Task'.
The class 'mission_Fork' is a specialization of 'ControlTask'.
The class 'mission_Join' is a specialization of 'ControlTask'.
The class 'mission_TaskDependency' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mission_PolygonTask' is a specialization of 'Task'.
The class 'mission_PointTask' is a specialization of 'Task'.
The class 'mission_LineTask' is a specialization of 'Task'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mission_Task' and 'mission_Mission'. From 'mission_Task', the role 'mission_Task' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mission_Mission', the role 'mission_Mission' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mission_Mission' and 'mission_TaskDependency'. From 'mission_Mission', the role 'mission_Mission2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mission_TaskDependency', the role 'mission_TaskDependency' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mission_Mission' and 'mission_Swarm'. From 'mission_Mission', the role 'mission_Mission4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mission_Swarm', the role 'mission_Swarm' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mission_Swarm' and 'mission_Drone'. From 'mission_Swarm', the role 'mission_Swarm6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mission_Drone', the role 'mission_Drone' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mission_Drone' and 'mission_Coordinate'. From 'mission_Drone', the role 'mission_Drone8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mission_Coordinate', the role 'mission_Coordinate' has cardinality 0..*.
