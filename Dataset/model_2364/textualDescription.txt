The domain model 'relational' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'relational_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relational_Table' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SqlDataType' defines the following possible values: 'CHAR', 'DATE', 'INTEGER', 'VARCHAR'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
