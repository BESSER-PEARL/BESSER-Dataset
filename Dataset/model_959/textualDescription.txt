The domain model 'simplegraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'simplegraph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplegraph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplegraph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simplegraph_Node' and 'simplegraph_Graph'. From 'simplegraph_Node', the role 'simplegraph_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplegraph_Graph', the role 'simplegraph_Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplegraph_Node' and 'simplegraph_Edge'. From 'simplegraph_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplegraph_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplegraph_Edge' and 'simplegraph_Node'. From 'simplegraph_Edge', the role 'Edge3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplegraph_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplegraph_Node' and 'simplegraph_Edge'. From 'simplegraph_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplegraph_Edge', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplegraph_Node' and 'simplegraph_Edge'. From 'simplegraph_Node', the role 'Node6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplegraph_Edge', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*.
