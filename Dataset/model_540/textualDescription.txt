The domain model 'families' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'families_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'families_District' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'families_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'District' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'families_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'families_Bike' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Pet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'families_Suburb' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'families_Family' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'averageAge', which is of type float; 'numberOfChildren', which is of type int; 'lotteryNumbers', which is of type int; 'id', which is of type str; 'address', which is of type str; 'nuclear', which is of type bool; 'averageAgePrecise', which is of type float.

'families_Pet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'male', which is of type bool.

'families_Band' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'families_Dog' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'loud', which is of type bool; 'breed', which is of type str.

'families_Account' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DogBreed' defines the following possible values: 'labrador', 'poodle'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'families_Family' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'families_Pet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'families_Person' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'families_Dog' is a specialization of 'Pet'.
The class 'families_Suburb' is a specialization of 'District'.
The class 'families_Model' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'families_Pet' and 'families_Family'. From 'families_Pet', the role 'families_Pet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'families_Family', the role 'families_Family' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'families_Family' and 'families_Person'. From 'families_Family', the role 'families_Family2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'families_Person', the role 'families_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'families_Dog' and 'families_Family'. From 'families_Dog', the role 'families_Dog' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'families_Family', the role 'families_Family4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'families_District' and 'families_Family'. From 'families_District', the role 'District' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'families_Family', the role 'families' has cardinality 0..*.
