The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sql4csv_Equality' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'sql4csv_BinaryCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'sql4csv_AndCondition' is a specialization of 'BinaryCondition'.
The class 'sql4csv_OrCondition' is a specialization of 'BinaryCondition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
