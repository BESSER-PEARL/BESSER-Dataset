The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'rules_core_BinaryExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rules_core_Plus' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Minus' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Mult' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Div' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Max' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Min' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Greater' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Lower' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Equals' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'rules_core_Constant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'rules_core_If' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rules_core_Expression' and 'rules_core_Rule'. From 'rules_core_Expression', the role 'rules_core_Expression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_core_Rule', the role 'rules_core_Rule' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_core_BinaryExp' and 'rules_core_Expression'. From 'rules_core_BinaryExp', the role 'rules_core_BinaryExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_core_Expression', the role 'rules_core_Expression2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_core_BinaryExp' and 'rules_core_Expression'. From 'rules_core_BinaryExp', the role 'rules_core_BinaryExp4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_core_Expression', the role 'rules_core_Expression5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_core_If' and 'rules_core_Expression'. From 'rules_core_If', the role 'rules_core_If' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_core_Expression', the role 'rules_core_Expression7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_core_If' and 'rules_core_Expression'. From 'rules_core_If', the role 'rules_core_If9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_core_Expression', the role 'rules_core_Expression10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rules_core_If' and 'rules_core_Expression'. From 'rules_core_If', the role 'rules_core_If12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rules_core_Expression', the role 'rules_core_Expression13' has cardinality 0..*.
