The domain model 'stateMachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'stateMachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'trigger', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'status', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'stateMachine_State' and 'stateMachine_StateMachine'. From 'stateMachine_State', the role 'stateMachine_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stateMachine_StateMachine' and 'stateMachine_Transition'. From 'stateMachine_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_Transition', the role 'stateMachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stateMachine_State' and 'stateMachine_StateMachine'. From 'stateMachine_State', the role 'stateMachine_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine_StateMachine4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stateMachine_Transition' and 'stateMachine_State'. From 'stateMachine_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_State', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stateMachine_Transition' and 'stateMachine_State'. From 'stateMachine_Transition', the role 'Transition8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_State', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stateMachine_State' and 'stateMachine_Transition'. From 'stateMachine_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_Transition', the role 'Outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
