The domain model 'conts' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'conts_H' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'conts_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'conts_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'conts_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'conts_Named' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'conts_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'conts_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'conts_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'conts_A' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'conts_B' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'conts_C' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'conts_E' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'conts_E' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'conts_F' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'conts_G' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'conts_H' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'conts_B' and 'conts_A'. From 'conts_B', the role 'conts_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'conts_A', the role 'conts_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'conts_B' and 'conts_C'. From 'conts_B', the role 'conts_B2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'conts_C', the role 'conts_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'conts_B' and 'conts_G'. From 'conts_B', the role 'conts_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'conts_G', the role 'conts_G' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'conts_F' and 'conts_E'. From 'conts_F', the role 'conts_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'conts_E', the role 'conts_E' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'conts_G' and 'conts_H'. From 'conts_G', the role 'conts_G7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'conts_H', the role 'conts_H' has cardinality 0..*.
