The domain model 'basicFsmEnv' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'basicFsmEnv_Trans' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'event', which is of type str.

'basicFsmEnv_VarDecl' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'basicFsmEnv_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'basicFsmEnv_Guard' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'basicFsmEnv_Machine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'basicFsmEnv_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'basicFsmEnv_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'basicFsmEnv_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'basicFsmEnv_State' and 'basicFsmEnv_Machine'. From 'basicFsmEnv_State', the role 'basicFsmEnv_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basicFsmEnv_Machine', the role 'basicFsmEnv_Machine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'basicFsmEnv_Trans' and 'basicFsmEnv_Machine'. From 'basicFsmEnv_Trans', the role 'basicFsmEnv_Trans' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basicFsmEnv_Machine', the role 'basicFsmEnv_Machine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'basicFsmEnv_Trans' and 'basicFsmEnv_State'. From 'basicFsmEnv_Trans', the role 'Trans' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basicFsmEnv_State', the role 'tgt' has cardinality 0..*.
