The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pyrep_Environment' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_Robot' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_IP' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_Wheel' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_MoveCollection' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_AbstractMove' is a specialization of 'AbstractDataMove'.
The class 'pyrep_AbstractCrossMove' is a specialization of 'AbstractDataMove'.
The class 'pyrep_DataMove' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_Move' is a specialization of 'DataMove'.
The class 'pyrep_Turn' is a specialization of 'DataMove'.
The class 'pyrep_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'pyrep_TypeSensor' is a specialization of 'Entity'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pyrep_Entity' and 'pyrep_Model'. From 'pyrep_Entity', the role 'pyrep_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pyrep_Model', the role 'pyrep_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pyrep_Environment' and 'pyrep_IP'. From 'pyrep_Environment', the role 'pyrep_Environment' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pyrep_IP', the role 'pyrep_IP' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pyrep_Environment' and 'pyrep_Robot'. From 'pyrep_Environment', the role 'pyrep_Environment3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pyrep_Robot', the role 'pyrep_Robot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pyrep_MoveCollection' and 'pyrep_Environment'. From 'pyrep_MoveCollection', the role 'pyrep_MoveCollection' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pyrep_Environment', the role 'pyrep_Environment5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pyrep_Wheel' and 'pyrep_Robot'. From 'pyrep_Wheel', the role 'pyrep_Wheel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pyrep_Robot', the role 'pyrep_Robot7' has cardinality 0..*.
