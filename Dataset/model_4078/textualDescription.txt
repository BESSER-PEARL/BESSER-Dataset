The domain model 'umlMM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'umlMM_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'umlMM_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'umlMM_Datatype' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'umlMM_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'umlMM_Associaton' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'umlMM_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'umlMM_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'umlMM_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'umlMM_Associaton' and 'umlMM_Package'. From 'umlMM_Associaton', the role 'Associaton' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM_Package', the role 'namespace' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM_Classifier' and 'umlMM_Package'. From 'umlMM_Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM_Package', the role 'namespace2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM_Associaton' and 'umlMM_Package'. From 'umlMM_Associaton', the role 'Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM_Package', the role 'Package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM_Class' and 'umlMM_Associaton'. From 'umlMM_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM_Associaton', the role 'destinationOf' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM_Class' and 'umlMM_Associaton'. From 'umlMM_Class', the role 'Class6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM_Associaton', the role 'sourceOf' has cardinality 0..*.
