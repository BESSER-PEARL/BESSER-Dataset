Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SourceType' defines the following possible values: 'DVD', 'CD', 'VHS', 'HDD', 'CASSETTE', 'OTHER'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'MediaLibrary_Smartphone' is a specialization of 'Device'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_EReader' is a specialization of 'Device'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Artifact' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_DurationArtifact' is a specialization of 'Artifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_AudioBook' is a specialization of 'DurationArtifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_MusicTrack' is a specialization of 'DurationArtifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Video' is a specialization of 'DurationArtifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Image' is a specialization of 'Artifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Ebook' is a specialization of 'Artifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_MediaSource' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_ExternalSource' is a specialization of 'MediaSource'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Store' is a specialization of 'MediaSource'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem' and 'MediaLibrary_Library'. From 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem', the role 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MediaLibrary_Library', the role 'MediaLibrary_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem' and 'MediaLibrary_Device'. From 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem', the role 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MediaLibrary_Device', the role 'MediaLibrary_Device' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem' and 'MediaLibrary_MediaSource'. From 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem', the role 'MediaLibrary_Ecosystem4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MediaLibrary_MediaSource', the role 'MediaLibrary_MediaSource' has cardinality 0..*.
