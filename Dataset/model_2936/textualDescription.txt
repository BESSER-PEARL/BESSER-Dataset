The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'test7_OptimizationSC' is a specialization of 'SolutionConstraint'.
The class 'test7_HardLimitSC' is a specialization of 'SolutionConstraint'.
The class 'test7_SelectionStateSC' is a specialization of 'SolutionConstraint'.
The class 'test7_FiniteDomainSC' is a specialization of 'SolutionConstraint'.
