The domain model 'gfsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'gfsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'gfsm_Guard' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'gfsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'event', which is of type str.

'gfsm_Machine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'gfsm_Transition' and 'gfsm_State'. From 'gfsm_Transition', the role 'outgoings' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_Transition' and 'gfsm_State'. From 'gfsm_Transition', the role 'incommings' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_State', the role 'State2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_Guard' and 'gfsm_Transition'. From 'gfsm_Guard', the role 'gfsm_Guard' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_Transition', the role 'gfsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_State' and 'gfsm_Transition'. From 'gfsm_State', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_State' and 'gfsm_Transition'. From 'gfsm_State', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_Transition', the role 'Transition6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_State' and 'gfsm_Machine'. From 'gfsm_State', the role 'gfsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_Machine', the role 'gfsm_Machine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_Transition' and 'gfsm_Machine'. From 'gfsm_Transition', the role 'gfsm_Transition10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_Machine', the role 'gfsm_Machine9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gfsm_Machine' and 'gfsm_State'. From 'gfsm_Machine', the role 'gfsm_Machine12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gfsm_State', the role 'gfsm_State13' has cardinality 0..*.
