'TypeA_BlockA' represents an important domain concept.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TypeA_PortA' and 'TypeA_BlockA'. From 'TypeA_PortA', the role 'TypeA_PortA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeA_BlockA', the role 'TypeA_BlockA' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TypeA_PortA' and 'TypeA_BlockA'. From 'TypeA_PortA', the role 'TypeA_PortA3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeA_BlockA', the role 'TypeA_BlockA2' has cardinality 0..*.
