The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sihuhu_World' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sihuhu_Track' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sihuhu_TrackElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sihuhu_Rail' is a specialization of 'TrackElement'.
The class 'sihuhu_Switch' is a specialization of 'TrackElement'.
The class 'sihuhu_SwitchConnection' is a specialization of 'Rail'.
The class 'sihuhu_Train' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sihuhu_Signal' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sihuhu_Track' and 'sihuhu_World'. From 'sihuhu_Track', the role 'sihuhu_Track' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sihuhu_World', the role 'sihuhu_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sihuhu_World' and 'sihuhu_Train'. From 'sihuhu_World', the role 'sihuhu_World2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sihuhu_Train', the role 'sihuhu_Train' has cardinality 0..*.
