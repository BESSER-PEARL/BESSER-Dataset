Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MessageType' defines the following possible values: 'NO_EDITING_RIGHTS', 'UPDATE', 'INFORMATION', 'LOCKED', 'FILTERED', 'ERROR', 'WARNING'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper' and 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper'. From 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper', the role 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper', the role 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper' and 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper'. From 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper', the role 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper', the role 'btsviewmodel_TreeNodeWrapper2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'btsviewmodel_StatusMessage' and 'btsviewmodel_StatusMessage'. From 'btsviewmodel_StatusMessage', the role 'btsviewmodel_StatusMessage5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'btsviewmodel_StatusMessage', the role 'btsviewmodel_StatusMessage' has cardinality 0..*.
