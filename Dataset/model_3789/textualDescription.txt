The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'model_TraceStackframe' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_TestCaseElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestProblem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_TestContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TraceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Metadata' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'key', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'TestElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_TestProblem' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'message', which is of type str; 'problemType', which is of type str.

'model_ComparisonProblem' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'actual', which is of type str; 'expected', which is of type str.

'model_TestElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'progressState', which is of type str; 'endTimestamp', which is of type str; 'testState', which is of type str; 'elementUnderTest', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'startTimestamp', which is of type str; 'target', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str.

'model_TestRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'testRunner', which is of type str.

'model_TraceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'message', which is of type str.

'model_TraceException' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ProblemType' defines the following possible values: 'ASSERTION', 'ERROR', 'ASSUMPTION'.
The enumeration 'TestState' defines the following possible values: 'PASS', 'IGNORED', 'FAILURE', 'NOT_RUN', 'ERROR'.
The enumeration 'ProgressState' defines the following possible values: 'RUNNING', 'NOT_STARTED', 'STOPPED', 'COMPLETED'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_TestContainer' is a specialization of 'TestElement'.
The class 'model_TestCaseElement' is a specialization of 'TestElement'.
The class 'model_TestRoot' is a specialization of 'TestContainer'.
The class 'model_ComparisonProblem' is a specialization of 'TestProblem'.
The class 'model_TraceException' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.
The class 'model_TraceStackframe' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_TestContainer' and 'model_TestElement'. From 'model_TestContainer', the role 'TestContainer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_TestElement', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_TestElement' and 'model_TestProblem'. From 'model_TestElement', the role 'model_TestElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_TestProblem', the role 'model_TestProblem' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_TestContainer' and 'model_TestElement'. From 'model_TestContainer', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_TestElement', the role 'TestElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_TraceElement' and 'model_TestProblem'. From 'model_TraceElement', the role 'model_TraceElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_TestProblem', the role 'model_TestProblem4' has cardinality 0..*.
