Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sAAP_State' and 'sAAP_Transition'. From 'sAAP_State', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sAAP_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sAAP_State' and 'sAAP_Transition'. From 'sAAP_State', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sAAP_Transition', the role 'Transition2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sAAP_StateMachine' and 'sAAP_State'. From 'sAAP_StateMachine', the role 'sAAP_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sAAP_State', the role 'sAAP_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sAAP_StateMachine' and 'sAAP_Transition'. From 'sAAP_StateMachine', the role 'sAAP_StateMachine5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sAAP_Transition', the role 'sAAP_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sAAP_State' and 'sAAP_Transition'. From 'sAAP_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sAAP_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sAAP_State' and 'sAAP_Transition'. From 'sAAP_State', the role 'State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sAAP_Transition', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*.
