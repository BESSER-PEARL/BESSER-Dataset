The domain model 'goatInfrastructure' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'goatInfrastructure_SingleServer' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'server', which is of type str; 'timeout', which is of type int.

'goatInfrastructure_Infrastructure' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'goatInfrastructure_Cluster' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mid_assigner', which is of type str; 'registration', which is of type str; 'message_queue', which is of type str; 'nodes', which is of type str.

'goatInfrastructure_Tree' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'registration', which is of type str.

'Infrastructure' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'goatInfrastructure_Ring' represents an important domain concept.

'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'address', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'goatInfrastructure_SingleServer' is a specialization of 'Infrastructure'.
The class 'goatInfrastructure_Cluster' is a specialization of 'Infrastructure'.
The class 'goatInfrastructure_Ring' is a specialization of 'Infrastructure'.
The class 'goatInfrastructure_Tree' is a specialization of 'Infrastructure'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'goatInfrastructure_Tree' and 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode'. From 'goatInfrastructure_Tree', the role 'goatInfrastructure_Tree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode', the role 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode' and 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode'. From 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode', the role 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode', the role 'goatInfrastructure_TreeNode3' has cardinality 0..*.
