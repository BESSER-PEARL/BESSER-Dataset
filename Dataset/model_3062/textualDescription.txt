Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'OperatorType' defines the following possible values: 'AND', 'OR'.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'Integer', 'Date', 'Boolean', 'Time', 'String', 'Year', 'None', 'Text', 'Email'.
The enumeration 'ConditionType' defines the following possible values: 'Enable', 'Disable', 'Hide', 'Show'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'forms_AttributePageElement' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'forms_RelationshipPageElement' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'forms_ListRelationshipPageElement' is a specialization of 'RelationshipPageElement'.
The class 'forms_TableRelationshipPageElement' is a specialization of 'RelationshipPageElement'.
The class 'forms_AttributeValueCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'forms_CompositeCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'forms_TextFields' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_TextAreas' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_SelectionFields' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_DateSelectionFields' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_TimeSelectionFields' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
