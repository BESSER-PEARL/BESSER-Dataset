The domain model 'p' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'p_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'p_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'p_A' and 'p_B'. From 'p_A', the role 'p_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p_B', the role 'p_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p_B' and 'p_C'. From 'p_B', the role 'p_B2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p_C', the role 'p_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p_C' and 'p_A'. From 'p_C', the role 'p_C4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p_A', the role 'p_A5' has cardinality 0..*.
