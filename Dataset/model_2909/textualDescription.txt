The domain model 'entitymm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entitymm_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'entitymm_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'entitymm_PrimitiveType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entitymm_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'entitymm_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'desc', which is of type str; 'size', which is of type int; 'isPersistent', which is of type bool.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'entitymm_PrimitiveType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'entitymm_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'entitymm_Model' and 'entitymm_Type'. From 'entitymm_Model', the role 'entitymm_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entitymm_Type', the role 'entitymm_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entitymm_Entity' and 'entitymm_Attribute'. From 'entitymm_Entity', the role 'Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entitymm_Attribute', the role 'attributes' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entitymm_PrimitiveType' and 'entitymm_Attribute'. From 'entitymm_PrimitiveType', the role 'entitymm_PrimitiveType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entitymm_Attribute', the role 'entitymm_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entitymm_Attribute' and 'entitymm_Entity'. From 'entitymm_Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entitymm_Entity', the role 'entity' has cardinality 0..*.
