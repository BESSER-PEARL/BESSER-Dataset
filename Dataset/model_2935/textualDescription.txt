The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'extended_PackageDeclaration' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'extended_Import' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'extended_DataType' is a specialization of 'AbstractType'.
The class 'extended_EntityType' is a specialization of 'AbstractType'.
The class 'extended_Entity' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'extended_Page' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'extended_FormTypes' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'extended_Form' is a specialization of 'FormTypes'.
The class 'extended_FormNewEntityOnly' is a specialization of 'FormTypes'.
The class 'extended_FormReport' is a specialization of 'FormTypes'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'extended_Domainmodel' and 'extended_AbstractElement'. From 'extended_Domainmodel', the role 'extended_Domainmodel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'extended_AbstractElement', the role 'extended_AbstractElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'extended_PackageDeclaration' and 'extended_AbstractElement'. From 'extended_PackageDeclaration', the role 'extended_PackageDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'extended_AbstractElement', the role 'extended_AbstractElement2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'extended_EntityType' and 'extended_Entity'. From 'extended_EntityType', the role 'extended_EntityType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'extended_Entity', the role 'extended_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'extended_Entity' and 'extended_Entity'. From 'extended_Entity', the role 'extended_Entity4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'extended_Entity', the role 'extended_Entity6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'extended_Feature' and 'extended_Entity'. From 'extended_Feature', the role 'extended_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'extended_Entity', the role 'extended_Entity8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'extended_AbstractType' and 'extended_Feature'. From 'extended_AbstractType', the role 'extended_AbstractType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'extended_Feature', the role 'extended_Feature10' has cardinality 0..*.
