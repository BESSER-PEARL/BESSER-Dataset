The domain model 'simplegraph2graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'simplegraph2graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplegraph2graph_Node2Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'Element2Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplegraph2graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplegraph2graph_Graph2Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplegraph2graph_Element2Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplegraph2graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplegraph2graph_Edge2Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplegraph2graph_Edge2Edge' is a specialization of 'Element2Element'.
The class 'simplegraph2graph_Node2Node' is a specialization of 'Element2Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
