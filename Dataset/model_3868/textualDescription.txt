The domain model 'core' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 20 main class(es).

'core_CORENamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'core_COREModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'core_COREPattern' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'core_COREFeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'COREFeatureRelationshipType' defines the following possible values: 'XOR', 'OR', 'Optional', 'Mandatory'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'core_COREModel' is a specialization of 'CORENamedElement'.
The class 'core_COREImpactModel' is a specialization of 'COREModel'.
The class 'core_COREConcern' is a specialization of 'CORENamedElement'.
The class 'core_COREFeature' is a specialization of 'COREModelElement'.
The class 'core_COREBinding' is a specialization of 'CORECompositionSpecification'.
The class 'core_COREModelElement' is a specialization of 'CORENamedElement'.
The class 'core_COREStrategy' is a specialization of 'CORENamedElement'.
The class 'core_COREPattern' is a specialization of 'CORECompositionSpecification'.
The class 'core_COREImpactModelElement' is a specialization of 'COREModelElement'.
The class 'core_COREConfiguration' is a specialization of 'CORENamedElement'.
The class 'core_COREFeatureModel' is a specialization of 'COREModel'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
