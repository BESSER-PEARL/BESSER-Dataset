Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ReferencingType' defines the following possible values: 'FULL', 'DEFAULT', 'PARTIAL'.
The enumeration 'DeferrableAct' defines the following possible values: 'NOT_DEFFERABLE', 'DEFFERABLE'.
The enumeration 'DeferredAct' defines the following possible values: 'INITIALLY_IMMEDIATE', 'INITIALLY_DEFERRED'.
The enumeration 'Action' defines the following possible values: 'NO_ACTION', 'SET_NULL', 'SET_DEFAULT', 'RESTRICT', 'CASCADE'.
