The domain model 'organizationchart' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'organizationchart_Organization' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'organizationchart_Employee' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'title', which is of type str; 'firstname', which is of type str; 'lastname', which is of type str; 'trigraph', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'StructureType' defines the following possible values: 'businessUnit', 'department', 'team', 'service', 'division'.
