The domain model 'testModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'AClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testModel_BClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'BClassAttr2', which is of type str; 'BClassAttr1', which is of type bool.

'testModel_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testModel_CClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'CClassAttr2', which is of type str; 'CClassAttr1', which is of type bool.

'testModel_AClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'AClassAttr1', which is of type bool; 'AClassAttr2', which is of type str.

'BClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'testModel_BClass' is a specialization of 'AClass'.
The class 'testModel_CClass' is a specialization of 'BClass'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testModel_AClass' and 'testModel_BClass'. From 'testModel_AClass', the role 'testModel_AClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testModel_BClass', the role 'testModel_BClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testModel_CClass' and 'testModel_BClass'. From 'testModel_CClass', the role 'testModel_CClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testModel_BClass', the role 'testModel_BClass2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testModel_EObject' and 'testModel_CClass'. From 'testModel_EObject', the role 'testModel_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testModel_CClass', the role 'testModel_CClass4' has cardinality 0..*.
