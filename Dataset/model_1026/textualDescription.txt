The domain model 'tp01' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'tp01_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tp01_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tp01_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tp01_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tp01_StartState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tp01_StartState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'tp01_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tp01_FSM' and 'tp01_State'. From 'tp01_FSM', the role 'tp01_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tp01_State', the role 'tp01_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tp01_FSM' and 'tp01_Transition'. From 'tp01_FSM', the role 'tp01_FSM2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tp01_Transition', the role 'tp01_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tp01_Transition' and 'tp01_State'. From 'tp01_Transition', the role 'tp01_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tp01_State', the role 'tp01_State5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tp01_State' and 'tp01_Transition'. From 'tp01_State', the role 'tp01_State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tp01_Transition', the role 'tp01_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
