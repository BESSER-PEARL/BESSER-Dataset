The domain model 'studyprogram' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'studyprogram_ElectiveCourses' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'studyprogram_SemesterCourse' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_StudyPlan' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semester', which is of type str; 'credits', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_ObligatoryCourses' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'studyprogram_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprogram_Year' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'studyprogram_University' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SemesterType' defines the following possible values: 'Fall', 'Spring'.
The enumeration 'CourseType' defines the following possible values: 'Obligatory', 'Elective'.
