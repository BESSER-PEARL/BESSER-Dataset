The domain model 'entities' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'ElementType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entities_BasicType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'typeName', which is of type str.

'entities_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'entities_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name_id', which is of type str.

'entities_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entities_EntityType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entities_AttributeType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'length', which is of type int; 'array', which is of type bool.

'entities_ElementType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'entities_BasicType' is a specialization of 'ElementType'.
The class 'entities_EntityType' is a specialization of 'ElementType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'entities_Model' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Model', the role 'entities_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Attribute' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Attribute', the role 'entities_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Attribute' and 'entities_AttributeType'. From 'entities_Attribute', the role 'entities_Attribute7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_AttributeType', the role 'entities_AttributeType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_AttributeType' and 'entities_ElementType'. From 'entities_AttributeType', the role 'entities_AttributeType9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_ElementType', the role 'entities_ElementType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_EntityType' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_EntityType', the role 'entities_EntityType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity11' has cardinality 0..*.
