Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'CourseWorkType' defines the following possible values: 'LECTURE', 'LABHOUR'.
The enumeration 'DeadlineEvaluation' defines the following possible values: 'PROJECT', 'ASSIGNMENT'.
The enumeration 'StudyProgramCode' defines the following possible values: 'MTIØT', 'MTDT', 'BIT', 'MIT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'course_desc_Exam' is a specialization of 'Evaluation'.
The class 'course_desc_Student' is a specialization of 'PersonRole'.
The class 'course_desc_Lecturer' is a specialization of 'PersonRole'.
The class 'course_desc_CourseCoordinator' is a specialization of 'PersonRole'.
The class 'course_desc_EvaluationWithDeadline' is a specialization of 'Evaluation'.
