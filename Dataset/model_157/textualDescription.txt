The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tokens', which is of type int.

'Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_InhibitorEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_OutputEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_InputEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_ReadEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Edge' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_InputEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.
The class 'petrinet_OutputEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.
The class 'petrinet_InhibitorEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.
The class 'petrinet_ReadEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Edge'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Edge', the role 'petrinet_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Edge' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'place' has cardinality 0..*.
