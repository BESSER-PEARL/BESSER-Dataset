The domain model 'relationaldatabase' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'relationaldatabase_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationaldatabase_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationaldatabase_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationaldatabase_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationaldatabase_RelationalDatabase' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'relationaldatabase_Table' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'relationaldatabase_Column' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'relationaldatabase_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'relationaldatabase_RelationalDatabase' and 'relationaldatabase_Table'. From 'relationaldatabase_RelationalDatabase', the role 'relationaldatabase_RelationalDatabase' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationaldatabase_Table', the role 'relationaldatabase_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationaldatabase_Table' and 'relationaldatabase_Column'. From 'relationaldatabase_Table', the role 'table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationaldatabase_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationaldatabase_Table' and 'relationaldatabase_Column'. From 'relationaldatabase_Table', the role 'tableAsPrimaryKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationaldatabase_Column', the role 'Column3' has cardinality 0..*.
