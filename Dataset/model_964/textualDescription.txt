The domain model 'DirectedGraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'DirectedGraph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'weight', which is of type str.

'DirectedGraph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'DirectedGraph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'DirectedGraph_GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'DirectedGraph_Node' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'DirectedGraph_Edge' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'DirectedGraph_GraphElement' and 'DirectedGraph_Graph'. From 'DirectedGraph_GraphElement', the role 'GraphElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DirectedGraph_Graph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DirectedGraph_Graph' and 'DirectedGraph_GraphElement'. From 'DirectedGraph_Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DirectedGraph_GraphElement', the role 'contents' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DirectedGraph_Edge' and 'DirectedGraph_Node'. From 'DirectedGraph_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DirectedGraph_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DirectedGraph_Edge' and 'DirectedGraph_Node'. From 'DirectedGraph_Edge', the role 'Edge4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DirectedGraph_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DirectedGraph_Node' and 'DirectedGraph_Edge'. From 'DirectedGraph_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DirectedGraph_Edge', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DirectedGraph_Edge' and 'DirectedGraph_Node'. From 'DirectedGraph_Edge', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DirectedGraph_Node', the role 'Node7' has cardinality 0..*.
