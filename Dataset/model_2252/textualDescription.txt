Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'OrgType' defines the following possible values: 'department', 'Misc', 'Discipline', 'Specjalization', 'school', 'major'.
The enumeration 'Role' defines the following possible values: 'student', 'teacher'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dXP_Course' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'dXP_AcademicSession' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'dXP_Class' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'dXP_User' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'dXP_Org' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'dXP_OrgUnit' is a specialization of 'Org'.
The class 'dXP_Enrolment' is a specialization of 'Base'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dXP_OneRoster' and 'dXP_AcademicSession'. From 'dXP_OneRoster', the role 'dXP_OneRoster' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dXP_AcademicSession', the role 'dXP_AcademicSession' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dXP_OneRoster' and 'dXP_Org'. From 'dXP_OneRoster', the role 'dXP_OneRoster2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dXP_Org', the role 'dXP_Org' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dXP_OneRoster' and 'dXP_Enrolment'. From 'dXP_OneRoster', the role 'dXP_OneRoster4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dXP_Enrolment', the role 'dXP_Enrolment' has cardinality 0..*.
