The domain model 'school' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'school_CourseOfStudy' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'school_SchoolDatabase' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'school_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'courseNumber', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'school_Faculty' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'school_CourseResult' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'grade', which is of type str.

'school_Teacher' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'school_Where' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'school_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'studentNumber', which is of type str.

'school_Query' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'school_School' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'school_BooleanExpr' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'rhs', which is of type str; 'lhs', which is of type str; 'operator', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SchoolElement' defines the following possible values: 'Student', 'School', 'CourseOfStudy', 'Faculty', 'Teacher', 'Course'.
