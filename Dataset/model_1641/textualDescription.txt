The domain model 'kwcs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'kwcs_TopCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TreeCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kwcs_BinCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kwcs_TreeCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kwcs_LeafCS' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'val', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'kwcs_BinCS' is a specialization of 'TreeCS'.
The class 'kwcs_LeafCS' is a specialization of 'TreeCS'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'kwcs_TreeCS' and 'kwcs_TopCS'. From 'kwcs_TreeCS', the role 'kwcs_TreeCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kwcs_TopCS', the role 'kwcs_TopCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kwcs_TreeCS' and 'kwcs_BinCS'. From 'kwcs_TreeCS', the role 'kwcs_TreeCS2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kwcs_BinCS', the role 'kwcs_BinCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kwcs_TreeCS' and 'kwcs_BinCS'. From 'kwcs_TreeCS', the role 'kwcs_TreeCS5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kwcs_BinCS', the role 'kwcs_BinCS4' has cardinality 0..*.
