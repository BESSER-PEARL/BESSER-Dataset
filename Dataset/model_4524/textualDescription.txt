Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TURN_DIRECTION' defines the following possible values: 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.
The enumeration 'MOVE_DIRECTION' defines the following possible values: 'BACKWARDS', 'FORWARDS'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_Main' is a specialization of 'ActionsList'.
The class 'model_EventListener' is a specialization of 'ActionsList'.
The class 'model_RotorAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'model_Move' is a specialization of 'RotorAction'.
The class 'model_Move' is a specialization of 'ContinuosAction'.
The class 'model_Move' is a specialization of 'RandomAction'.
The class 'model_Turn' is a specialization of 'RotorAction'.
The class 'model_Turn' is a specialization of 'ContinuosAction'.
The class 'model_Turn' is a specialization of 'RandomAction'.
The class 'model_Stop' is a specialization of 'ContinuosAction'.
The class 'model_Repeat' is a specialization of 'Ending'.
The class 'model_StartOver' is a specialization of 'Ending'.
The class 'model_Wait' is a specialization of 'Ending'.
The class 'model_Obstacle' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'model_Tapped' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'model_ContinuosAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'model_RandomAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_RoboProse' and 'model_Root'. From 'model_RoboProse', the role 'model_RoboProse' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Root', the role 'model_Root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_RoboProse' and 'model_Main'. From 'model_RoboProse', the role 'model_RoboProse2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Main', the role 'model_Main' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_RoboProse' and 'model_EventListener'. From 'model_RoboProse', the role 'model_RoboProse4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_EventListener', the role 'model_EventListener' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_EventListener' and 'model_EventListener'. From 'model_EventListener', the role 'model_EventListener7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_EventListener', the role 'model_EventListener5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Event' and 'model_EventListener'. From 'model_Event', the role 'model_Event' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_EventListener', the role 'model_EventListener9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Action' and 'model_ActionsList'. From 'model_Action', the role 'model_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_ActionsList', the role 'model_ActionsList' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Ending' and 'model_ActionsList'. From 'model_Ending', the role 'model_Ending' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_ActionsList', the role 'model_ActionsList12' has cardinality 0..*.
