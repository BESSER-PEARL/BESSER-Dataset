The domain model 'states' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'states_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'states_ActionExecution' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'states_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'states_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'states_StateSystem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'states_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'states_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'qualifiedName', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'states_State' and 'states_StateSystem'. From 'states_State', the role 'states_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'states_StateSystem', the role 'states_StateSystem' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'states_Transition' and 'states_StateSystem'. From 'states_Transition', the role 'states_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'states_StateSystem', the role 'states_StateSystem2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'states_Trace' and 'states_StateSystem'. From 'states_Trace', the role 'states_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'states_StateSystem', the role 'states_StateSystem4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'states_State' and 'states_Transition'. From 'states_State', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'states_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'states_Transition' and 'states_State'. From 'states_Transition', the role 'Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'states_State', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'states_State' and 'states_EObject'. From 'states_State', the role 'states_State9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'states_EObject', the role 'states_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
