The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statesml_State' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_SelectionDivergence' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_SelectionConvergence' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_ChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
