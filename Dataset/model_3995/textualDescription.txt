The domain model 'Class' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'Class_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isAbstract', which is of type bool.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Class_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'multiValued', which is of type bool.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Class_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'Class_Classifier' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'Class_DataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'Class_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'Class_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Class_Classifier' and 'Class_Package'. From 'Class_Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Package', the role 'package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class_Classifier' and 'Class_Package'. From 'Class_Classifier', the role 'elems' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Package', the role 'Package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class_Class' and 'Class_Class'. From 'Class_Class', the role 'Class_Class2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Class', the role 'Class_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class_Class' and 'Class_Attribute'. From 'Class_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class_Attribute' and 'Class_Classifier'. From 'Class_Attribute', the role 'Class_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Classifier', the role 'Class_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class_Attribute' and 'Class_Class'. From 'Class_Attribute', the role 'att' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
