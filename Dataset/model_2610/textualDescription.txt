The class 'Company_European' is a specialization of 'Project'.
The class 'Company_National' is a specialization of 'Project'.
The class 'Company_Unit' is a specialization of 'Division'.
The class 'Company_ServiceLine' is a specialization of 'Division'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Company_Project' and 'Company_Person'. From 'Company_Project', the role 'Company_Project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Company_Person', the role 'Company_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Company_Person' and 'Company_ServiceLine'. From 'Company_Person', the role 'Company_Person2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Company_ServiceLine', the role 'Company_ServiceLine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Company_Person' and 'Company_Company'. From 'Company_Person', the role 'Company_Person4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Company_Company', the role 'Company_Company' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Company_Project' and 'Company_Company'. From 'Company_Project', the role 'Company_Project7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Company_Company', the role 'Company_Company6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Company_Company' and 'Company_Address'. From 'Company_Company', the role 'Company_Company9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Company_Address', the role 'Company_Address' has cardinality 0..*.
