The class 'executionTrace_ActivityEdgeTraversal' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_StoryPatternExecution' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_StoryPatternObjectExecution' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_StoryPatternLinkExecution' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_ExpressionEvaluation' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_InstanceObjectModification' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_InstanceLinkModification' is a specialization of 'Execution'.
The class 'executionTrace_AttributeValueSet' is a specialization of 'Execution'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'executionTrace_ExecutionTrace' and 'executionTrace_Execution'. From 'executionTrace_ExecutionTrace', the role 'executionTrace_ExecutionTrace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'executionTrace_Execution', the role 'executionTrace_Execution' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'executionTrace_Execution' and 'executionTrace_Execution'. From 'executionTrace_Execution', the role 'container' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'executionTrace_Execution', the role 'Execution' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'executionTrace_Execution' and 'executionTrace_Execution'. From 'executionTrace_Execution', the role 'Execution5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'executionTrace_Execution', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*.
