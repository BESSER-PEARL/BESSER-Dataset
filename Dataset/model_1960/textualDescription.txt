The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'addressbook_Person' is a specialization of 'Contact'.
The class 'addressbook_Company' is a specialization of 'Contact'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'addressbook_Contact' and 'addressbook_Address'. From 'addressbook_Contact', the role 'addressbook_Contact' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Address', the role 'addressbook_Address' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_Contact' and 'addressbook_Contact'. From 'addressbook_Contact', the role 'addressbook_Contact1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Contact', the role 'addressbook_Contact3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_Contact' and 'addressbook_Relationship'. From 'addressbook_Contact', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Relationship', the role 'Relationship' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_Contact' and 'addressbook_Relationship'. From 'addressbook_Contact', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Relationship', the role 'Relationship6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_Contact' and 'addressbook_Note'. From 'addressbook_Contact', the role 'addressbook_Contact8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Note', the role 'addressbook_Note' has cardinality 0..*.
