Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'training_Training' and 'training_Session'. From 'training_Training', the role 'Training' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Session', the role 'session' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Trainer' and 'training_Session'. From 'training_Trainer', the role 'training_Trainer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Session' and 'training_Person'. From 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Person', the role 'training_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Person' and 'training_TrainingOrganization'. From 'training_Person', the role 'training_Person5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_TrainingOrganization', the role 'training_TrainingOrganization' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Session' and 'training_TrainingOrganization'. From 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_TrainingOrganization', the role 'training_TrainingOrganization7' has cardinality 0..*.
