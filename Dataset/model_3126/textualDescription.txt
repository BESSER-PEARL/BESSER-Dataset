The domain model 'umlMM_' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'umlMM__Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'umlMM__Association' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'umlMM__Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'umlMM__PrimitiveDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'umlMM__dummy' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'umlMM__Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'umlMM__Package' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'KIND' defines the following possible values: 'PERSISTENT', 'OTHER'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'umlMM__Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'umlMM__PrimitiveDataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'umlMM__Package' and 'umlMM__Classifier'. From 'umlMM__Package', the role 'namespace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM__Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM__Association' and 'umlMM__Package'. From 'umlMM__Association', the role 'Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM__Package', the role 'namespace2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM__dummy' and 'umlMM__Package'. From 'umlMM__dummy', the role 'dummy' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM__Package', the role 'containsPackage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM__Class' and 'umlMM__Attribute'. From 'umlMM__Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM__Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'umlMM__Class' and 'umlMM__Class'. From 'umlMM__Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'umlMM__Class', the role 'subclass' has cardinality 0..*.
