Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Classifier' defines the following possible values: 'String', 'Class', 'Integer', 'Double'.
The enumeration 'LogicOperators' defines the following possible values: 'or', 'not', 'and'.
The enumeration 'RelationalOperators' defines the following possible values: 'greater_or_equals', 'greater', 'equals', 'not_equals', 'lesser', 'lesser_or_equals'.
The enumeration 'MathOperators' defines the following possible values: 'multiple', 'minus', 'plus', 'divide'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'Model_ExtTrans' is a specialization of 'PhaseTransition'.
The class 'Model_SimplePredicate' is a specialization of 'Predicate'.
The class 'Model_Expression' is a specialization of 'Predicate'.
