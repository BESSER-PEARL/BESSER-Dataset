The domain model 'GraphWiki' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'GraphWiki_ArticleGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphWiki_Revision' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'date', which is of type str; 'text_id', which is of type int; 'user', which is of type str.

'GraphWiki_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'GraphWiki_ClassificationGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphWiki_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'GraphWiki_IndexGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphWiki_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'title', which is of type str; 'visits', which is of type int; 'node_id', which is of type int; 'editions', which is of type int; 'type', which is of type str; 'node_namespace', which is of type int.

'Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'GraphWiki_IndexGraph' is a specialization of 'Graph'.
The class 'GraphWiki_CategoryGraph' is a specialization of 'Graph'.
The class 'GraphWiki_ArticleGraph' is a specialization of 'Graph'.
The class 'GraphWiki_ClassificationGraph' is a specialization of 'Graph'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
