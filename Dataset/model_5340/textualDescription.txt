The domain model 'A' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'A_A1' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

'A_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'A_A2' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'A_A' and 'A_A1'. From 'A_A', the role 'A_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_A1', the role 'A_A1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'A_A1' and 'A_A2'. From 'A_A1', the role 'A_A12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_A2', the role 'A_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
