The model defines 6 main class(es).

'family_Man' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'EModelElement' represents an important domain concept.

The class 'family_Person' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'family_Man' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'family_Woman' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'family_Family' and 'family_Man'. From 'family_Family', the role 'family_Family' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Man', the role 'family_Man' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Family' and 'family_Woman'. From 'family_Family', the role 'family_Family2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Woman', the role 'family_Woman' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Family' and 'family_Family'. From 'family_Family', the role 'family_Family5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Family', the role 'family_Family3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Person' and 'family_Man'. From 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Man', the role 'family_Man7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Woman' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Woman', the role 'family_Woman10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Person' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person11' has cardinality 0..*.
