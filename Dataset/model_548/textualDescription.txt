The domain model 'trackit' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'trackit_Member' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'lastName', which is of type str; 'firstName', which is of type str; 'fullName', which is of type str.

'trackit_IssueTracker' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'projectName', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VersionStatus' defines the following possible values: 'COMPLETE', 'IN_PROGRESS'.
The enumeration 'IssueType' defines the following possible values: 'BUG', 'DUPLICATE', 'ENHANCEMENT', 'WONT_FIX', 'HELP_REQUIRED'.
The enumeration 'IssueStatus' defines the following possible values: 'CLOSED', 'OPEN'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trackit_Member' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'trackit_Team' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'trackit_Product' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'trackit_Version' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'trackit_Issue' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'trackit_Comment' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
