The domain model 'dot' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'dot_Subgraph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'dot_EdgeTarget' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'operator', which is of type str.

'dot_EdgeStatement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dot_AttributeStatement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'dot_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'dot_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'dot_Port' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'compass_pt', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'dot_GraphvizModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Statement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dot_Statement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dot_NodeStatement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dot_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'strict', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EdgeOperator' defines the following possible values: 'directed', 'undirected'.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'node', 'graph', 'edge'.
The enumeration 'GraphType' defines the following possible values: 'digraph', 'graph'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dot_Attribute' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'dot_NodeStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'dot_EdgeStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'dot_AttributeStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'dot_Subgraph' is a specialization of 'Statement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dot_Graph' and 'dot_GraphvizModel'. From 'dot_Graph', the role 'dot_Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dot_GraphvizModel', the role 'dot_GraphvizModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dot_Graph' and 'dot_Statement'. From 'dot_Graph', the role 'dot_Graph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dot_Statement', the role 'dot_Statement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dot_NodeStatement' and 'dot_Node'. From 'dot_NodeStatement', the role 'dot_NodeStatement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dot_Node', the role 'dot_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dot_Attribute' and 'dot_NodeStatement'. From 'dot_Attribute', the role 'dot_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dot_NodeStatement', the role 'dot_NodeStatement5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dot_Node' and 'dot_Port'. From 'dot_Node', the role 'dot_Node7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dot_Port', the role 'dot_Port' has cardinality 0..*.
