Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PseudostateKind' defines the following possible values: 'choice', 'initial', 'fork', 'junction', 'join'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statemachines_CustomEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Region' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_State' is a specialization of 'almostuml_NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_State' is a specialization of 'almostuml_Vertex'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Vertex' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Trigger' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Behavior' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Event' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statemachines_almostuml_Pseudostate' is a specialization of 'State'.
