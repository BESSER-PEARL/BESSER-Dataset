The domain model 'simplePDL' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplePDL_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplePDL_WorkProduct' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplePDL_WorkDefinitionParameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'parameterKind', which is of type str.

'simplePDL_WorkSequence' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'linkType', which is of type str.

'simplePDL_Activity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplePDL_WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplePDL_SubProcess' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'WorkSequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'startToStart', 'finishToStart', 'finishTofinish', 'startToFinish'.
The enumeration 'ParameterDirectionKind' defines the following possible values: 'inout', 'out', 'in'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplePDL_SubProcess' is a specialization of 'WorkDefinition'.
The class 'simplePDL_Activity' is a specialization of 'WorkDefinition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition' and 'simplePDL_Process'. From 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition', the role 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplePDL_Process', the role 'simplePDL_Process' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplePDL_Process' and 'simplePDL_WorkSequence'. From 'simplePDL_Process', the role 'simplePDL_Process2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplePDL_WorkSequence', the role 'simplePDL_WorkSequence' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplePDL_WorkSequence' and 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition'. From 'simplePDL_WorkSequence', the role 'WorkSequence' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition', the role 'linksToSuccessors' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition' and 'simplePDL_WorkSequence'. From 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition', the role 'linksToPredecessors' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplePDL_WorkSequence', the role 'WorkSequence5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition' and 'simplePDL_WorkDefinitionParameter'. From 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition', the role 'simplePDL_WorkDefinition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplePDL_WorkDefinitionParameter', the role 'simplePDL_WorkDefinitionParameter' has cardinality 0..*.
