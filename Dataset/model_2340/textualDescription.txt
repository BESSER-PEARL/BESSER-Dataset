An association connects 'Persons_Community' and 'Persons_Person'. From 'Persons_Community', the role 'Persons_Community' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_Person', the role 'Persons_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Persons_Community' and 'Persons_TownHall'. From 'Persons_Community', the role 'Persons_Community2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_TownHall', the role 'Persons_TownHall' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Persons_Association' and 'Persons_Community'. From 'Persons_Association', the role 'Persons_Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_Community', the role 'Persons_Community4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Persons_Person' and 'Persons_TownHall'. From 'Persons_Person', the role 'Persons_Person7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_TownHall', the role 'Persons_TownHall6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Persons_Committee' and 'Persons_TownHall'. From 'Persons_Committee', the role 'Persons_Committee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_TownHall', the role 'Persons_TownHall9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Persons_District' and 'Persons_TownHall'. From 'Persons_District', the role 'Persons_District' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_TownHall', the role 'Persons_TownHall11' has cardinality 0..*.
