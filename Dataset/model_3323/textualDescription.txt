The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Java_VoidType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Java_ObjectType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Java_PrimitiveType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Java_Class' is a specialization of 'ObjectType'.
The class 'Java_Interface' is a specialization of 'ObjectType'.
The class 'Java_Method' is a specialization of 'MethodSignature'.
The class 'Java_MethodCall' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'Java_VariableDeclaration' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'Java_Assignment' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'Java_Return' is a specialization of 'Statement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ObjectType' and 'Java_Package'. From 'ObjectType', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Java_Package', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_ObjectType' and 'Package'. From 'Java_ObjectType', the role '02' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Package', the role '#3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Class' and 'Interface'. From 'Java_Class', the role 'Java_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Interface', the role 'Interface' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Class' and 'Class'. From 'Java_Class', the role 'Java_Class6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Field' and 'Java_Class'. From 'Field', the role '#9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Java_Class', the role '08' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Class' and 'Method'. From 'Java_Class', the role 'Java_Class11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Method', the role 'Method' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Interface' and 'Interface'. From 'Java_Interface', the role 'Java_Interface' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Interface', the role 'Interface13' has cardinality 0..*.
