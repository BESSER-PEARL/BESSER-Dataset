The domain model 'people' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'people_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'people_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'alive', which is of type bool; 'nicknames', which is of type str; 'lotteryChances', which is of type str; 'luckyNumbers', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str; 'age', which is of type int.

'people_Pet' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PetKind' defines the following possible values: 'FRIENDLY', 'INDEPENDENT', 'DANGEROUS'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'people_Model' and 'people_Person'. From 'people_Model', the role 'people_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'people_Person', the role 'people_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'people_Person' and 'people_Person'. From 'people_Person', the role 'people_Person1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'people_Person', the role 'people_Person3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'people_Pet' and 'people_Person'. From 'people_Pet', the role 'people_Pet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'people_Person', the role 'people_Person5' has cardinality 0..*.
