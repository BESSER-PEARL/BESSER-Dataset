An association connects 'family_Female' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Female', the role 'family_Female' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Person' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Person' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Person' and 'family_FamilyTree'. From 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_FamilyTree', the role 'family_FamilyTree' has cardinality 0..*.
