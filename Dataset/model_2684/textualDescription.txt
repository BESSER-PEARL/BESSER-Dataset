Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simplecont_A' and 'simplecont_B'. From 'simplecont_A', the role 'simplecont_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplecont_B', the role 'simplecont_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplecont_A' and 'simplecont_C'. From 'simplecont_A', the role 'simplecont_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplecont_C', the role 'simplecont_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplecont_B' and 'simplecont_C'. From 'simplecont_B', the role 'simplecont_B5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplecont_C', the role 'simplecont_C4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplecont_X' and 'simplecont_A'. From 'simplecont_X', the role 'simplecont_X' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplecont_A', the role 'simplecont_A7' has cardinality 0..*.
