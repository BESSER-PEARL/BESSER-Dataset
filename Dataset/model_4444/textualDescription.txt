Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Compare' defines the following possible values: 'einf', 'inf', 'equal', 'esup', 'sup'.
The enumeration 'Signal' defines the following possible values: 'LOW', 'HIGH'.
The enumeration 'Time_unit' defines the following possible values: 'ms', 's', 'min'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'arduinoML_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_Analog' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_Mode' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_TransitionState' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'arduinoML_TransitionMode' is a specialization of 'Transition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
