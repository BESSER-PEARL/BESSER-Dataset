Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pltest_Common' and 'pltest_Child1'. From 'pltest_Common', the role 'pltest_Common' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_Child1', the role 'pltest_Child1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pltest_Common' and 'pltest_Child2'. From 'pltest_Common', the role 'pltest_Common2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_Child2', the role 'pltest_Child2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pltest_Circle' and 'pltest_Red'. From 'pltest_Circle', the role 'pltest_Circle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_Red', the role 'pltest_Red' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pltest_Circle' and 'pltest_WhatEver'. From 'pltest_Circle', the role 'pltest_Circle5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_WhatEver', the role 'pltest_WhatEver' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pltest_TestPackageableElement' and 'pltest_TestPackage'. From 'pltest_TestPackageableElement', the role 'pltest_TestPackageableElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_TestPackage', the role 'pltest_TestPackage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pltest_TestPackage' and 'pltest_TestPackageableElement'. From 'pltest_TestPackage', the role 'pltest_TestPackage8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_TestPackageableElement', the role 'pltest_TestPackageableElement9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pltest_TestClassifier' and 'pltest_TestClass'. From 'pltest_TestClassifier', the role 'pltest_TestClassifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pltest_TestClass', the role 'pltest_TestClass' has cardinality 0..*.
