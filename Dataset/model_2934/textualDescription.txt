The domain model 'domainDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'domainDsl_Domainmodel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'domainDsl_Validator' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'svalue', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type int.

'domainDsl_Import' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'importedNamespace', which is of type str.

'domainDsl_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'domainDsl_PackageDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'domainDsl_AbstractElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'domainDsl_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'domainDsl_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'defaultVal', which is of type str; 'many', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'domainDsl_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'domainDsl_EType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'domainDsl_PackageDeclaration' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'domainDsl_Import' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'domainDsl_Type' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'domainDsl_DataType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'domainDsl_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'domainDsl_AbstractElement' and 'domainDsl_Domainmodel'. From 'domainDsl_AbstractElement', the role 'domainDsl_AbstractElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'domainDsl_Domainmodel', the role 'domainDsl_Domainmodel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'domainDsl_AbstractElement' and 'domainDsl_PackageDeclaration'. From 'domainDsl_AbstractElement', the role 'domainDsl_AbstractElement2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'domainDsl_PackageDeclaration', the role 'domainDsl_PackageDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'domainDsl_Entity' and 'domainDsl_Entity'. From 'domainDsl_Entity', the role 'domainDsl_Entity3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'domainDsl_Entity', the role 'domainDsl_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'domainDsl_Feature' and 'domainDsl_Entity'. From 'domainDsl_Feature', the role 'domainDsl_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'domainDsl_Entity', the role 'domainDsl_Entity6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'domainDsl_Feature' and 'domainDsl_Type'. From 'domainDsl_Feature', the role 'domainDsl_Feature8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'domainDsl_Type', the role 'domainDsl_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'domainDsl_Feature' and 'domainDsl_Validator'. From 'domainDsl_Feature', the role 'domainDsl_Feature10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'domainDsl_Validator', the role 'domainDsl_Validator' has cardinality 0..*.
