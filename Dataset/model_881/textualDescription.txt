The domain model 'simplepdl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'simplepdl_ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplepdl_WorkSequence' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'linkType', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_Ressource' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'count', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplepdl_Guidance' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplepdl_Allocation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'count', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'WorkSequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'startToStart', 'finishToFinish', 'startToFinish', 'finishToStart'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_WorkSequence' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_Guidance' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_Ressource' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simplepdl_ProcessElement' and 'simplepdl_Process'. From 'simplepdl_ProcessElement', the role 'ProcessElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplepdl_Process', the role 'process' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplepdl_WorkSequence' and 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition'. From 'simplepdl_WorkSequence', the role 'WorkSequence' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition', the role 'successor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition' and 'simplepdl_WorkSequence'. From 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition', the role 'predecessor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplepdl_WorkSequence', the role 'WorkSequence3' has cardinality 0..*.
