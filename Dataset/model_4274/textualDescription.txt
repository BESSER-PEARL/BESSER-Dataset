An association connects 'bowling_League' and 'bowling_Player'. From 'bowling_League', the role 'bowling_League' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_Player', the role 'bowling_Player' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bowling_Matchup' and 'bowling_Tournament'. From 'bowling_Matchup', the role 'bowling_Matchup' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_Tournament', the role 'bowling_Tournament' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bowling_Tournament' and 'bowling_League'. From 'bowling_Tournament', the role 'bowling_Tournament4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_League', the role 'bowling_League5' has cardinality 0..*.
