The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'trace_SourceElementList' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_TargetElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_TraceProperty' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'resolved', which is of type bool; 'propertyName', which is of type str.

'trace_SourceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'mapsToSelf', which is of type bool.

'trace_TraceLinkSet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_TraceLink' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'overridden', which is of type bool.

'trace_TracedRule' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'rule', which is of type str.

'trace_TraceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'runtimeObject', which is of type str.

'TraceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trace_SourceElement' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.
The class 'trace_TargetElement' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
