An association connects 'Sample_Book' and 'Sample_Library'. From 'Sample_Book', the role 'Sample_Book' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Sample_Library', the role 'Sample_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Sample_Book' and 'Sample_Person'. From 'Sample_Book', the role 'Sample_Book2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Sample_Person', the role 'Sample_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Sample_EString' and 'Sample_Book'. From 'Sample_EString', the role 'Sample_EString' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Sample_Book', the role 'Sample_Book4' has cardinality 0..*.
