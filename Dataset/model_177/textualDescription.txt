An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_Net'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Net', the role 'petrinet_Net' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Net' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_Net', the role 'petrinet_Net2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Token' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_Token', the role 'petrinet_Token' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_NetStopEvent' and 'petrinet_Net'. From 'petrinet_NetStopEvent', the role 'petrinet_NetStopEvent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Net', the role 'petrinet_Net12' has cardinality 0..*.
