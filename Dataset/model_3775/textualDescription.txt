'features_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'features_Model' and 'features_Feature'. From 'features_Model', the role 'features_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'features_Feature' and 'features_Feature'. From 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'features_Feature' and 'features_Feature'. From 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'features_Feature' and 'features_Feature'. From 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'features_Feature' and 'features_Feature'. From 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'features_Feature', the role 'features_Feature12' has cardinality 0..*.
