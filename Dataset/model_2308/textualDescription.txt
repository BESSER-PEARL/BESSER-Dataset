The domain model 'PrimitiveTypes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Person' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Persons_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'fullName', which is of type str.

'Persons_PersonsModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Persons_Male' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'age', which is of type int.

'PersonsModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Persons_Female' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'age', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Persons_Male' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'Persons_Female' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Persons_Person' and 'PersonsModel'. From 'Persons_Person', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonsModel', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Person' and 'Persons_PersonsModel'. From 'Person', the role '#3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Persons_PersonsModel', the role '02' has cardinality 0..*.
