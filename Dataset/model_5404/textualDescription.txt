The domain model 'UML2WithID' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'UML2WithID_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'UML2WithID_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ID', which is of type str.

'UML2WithID_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'direction', which is of type str.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ParameterDirectionKind' defines the following possible values: 'out', 'in', 'inout', 'return'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'UML2WithID_Parameter' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'UML2WithID_Operation' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_Parameter' and 'UML2WithID_Operation'. From 'UML2WithID_Parameter', the role 'UML2WithID_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_Operation', the role 'UML2WithID_Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
