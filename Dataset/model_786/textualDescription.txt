The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'output', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str.

'fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_RuntimeConcept2' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'bar', which is of type str.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_RuntimeConcept1' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'foo', which is of type int.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_RuntimeConcept2' and 'fsm_RuntimeConcept1'. From 'fsm_RuntimeConcept2', the role 'fsm_RuntimeConcept2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_RuntimeConcept1', the role 'fsm_RuntimeConcept1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role '11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '20' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '21' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_RuntimeConcept1' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_RuntimeConcept1', the role 'fsm_RuntimeConcept123' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State24' has cardinality 0..*.
