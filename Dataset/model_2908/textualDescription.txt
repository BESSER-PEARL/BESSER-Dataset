The domain model 'entity' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'entity_TypeDef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entity_JAVAID' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'entity_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entity_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'entity_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'many', which is of type bool.

'entity_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'entity_TypeDef' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'entity_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'entity_Model' and 'entity_Type'. From 'entity_Model', the role 'entity_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entity_Type', the role 'entity_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entity_TypeDef' and 'entity_JAVAID'. From 'entity_TypeDef', the role 'entity_TypeDef' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entity_JAVAID', the role 'entity_JAVAID' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entity_Entity' and 'entity_Entity'. From 'entity_Entity', the role 'entity_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entity_Entity', the role 'entity_Entity2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entity_Attribute' and 'entity_Entity'. From 'entity_Attribute', the role 'entity_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entity_Entity', the role 'entity_Entity5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entity_Attribute' and 'entity_Type'. From 'entity_Attribute', the role 'entity_Attribute7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entity_Type', the role 'entity_Type8' has cardinality 0..*.
