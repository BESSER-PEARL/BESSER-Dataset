The domain model 'faultTree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'faultTree_PrimaryEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'probability', which is of type float; 'type', which is of type str.

'Transfer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Event' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_IntermediateEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'probability', which is of type float.

'faultTree_ConditioningEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'condition', which is of type str.

'faultTree_TransferIn' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_TransferOut' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'faultTree_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'faultTree_Transfer' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'faultTree_Gate' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'probability', which is of type float; 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'faultTree_FaultTree' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PrimaryEventType' defines the following possible values: 'EXTERNAL', 'UNDEVELOPED', 'BASIC'.
The enumeration 'GateType' defines the following possible values: 'XOR', 'PAND', 'OR', 'AND', 'INHIBIT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'faultTree_IntermediateEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'faultTree_PrimaryEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'faultTree_ConditioningEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'faultTree_TransferIn' is a specialization of 'Transfer'.
The class 'faultTree_TransferOut' is a specialization of 'Transfer'.
