Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Sex' defines the following possible values: 'FEMALE', 'MALE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_ConcreteTypeOne' is a specialization of 'AbstractType'.
The class 'model_ConcreteTypeTwo' is a specialization of 'AbstractType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
