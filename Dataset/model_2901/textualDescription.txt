The domain model 'myDSL' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'myDSL_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDSL_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'myDSL_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'abstract', which is of type bool.

'myDSL_EntityModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDSL_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDSL_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FeatureKind' defines the following possible values: 'attribute', 'containment', 'reference'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDSL_Type' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'myDSL_DataType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'myDSL_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'myDSL_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDSL_Entity' and 'myDSL_Feature'. From 'myDSL_Entity', the role 'myDSL_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDSL_Feature', the role 'myDSL_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDSL_Type' and 'myDSL_EntityModel'. From 'myDSL_Type', the role 'myDSL_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDSL_EntityModel', the role 'myDSL_EntityModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDSL_Feature' and 'myDSL_Type'. From 'myDSL_Feature', the role 'myDSL_Feature3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDSL_Type', the role 'myDSL_Type4' has cardinality 0..*.
