The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metamodel_PlainVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'metamodel_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_TransientVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'metamodel_Controller' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_StaticVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'metamodel_View' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_Model' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
