The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'statemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Resource' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Simple' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Initial' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Composite' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Id', which is of type int; 'duration', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statemachine_Initial' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statemachine_Simple' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statemachine_Composite' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine_StateMachine' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_StateMachine' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_StateMachine' and 'statemachine_Resource'. From 'statemachine_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine_StateMachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Resource', the role 'statemachine_Resource' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Resource' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Resource', the role 'statemachine_Resource13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Composite'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Composite', the role 'statemachine_Composite' has cardinality 0..*.
