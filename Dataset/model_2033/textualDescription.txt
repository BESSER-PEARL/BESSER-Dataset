The domain model 'network' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'network_CurrentStateMapState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'network_RunTimeNetwork' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'network_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Event', which is of type str.

'AbstractElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'network_ChannelBuffer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'network_AbstractElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'network_Channel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Type', which is of type str.

'network_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'network_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'network_Network' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Event' defines the following possible values: 'RECEIVE', 'SEND'.
The enumeration 'TypeOfChannel' defines the following possible values: 'Synchronous', 'Asynchronous'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'network_Network' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'network_Statemachine' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'network_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'network_Channel' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'network_Statemachine' and 'network_Network'. From 'network_Statemachine', the role 'network_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'network_Network', the role 'network_Network' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'network_Channel' and 'network_Network'. From 'network_Channel', the role 'network_Channel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'network_Network', the role 'network_Network2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'network_Statemachine' and 'network_State'. From 'network_Statemachine', the role 'network_Statemachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'network_State', the role 'network_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'network_Statemachine' and 'network_State'. From 'network_Statemachine', the role 'network_Statemachine6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'network_State', the role 'network_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'network_Statemachine' and 'network_Transition'. From 'network_Statemachine', the role 'network_Statemachine9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'network_Transition', the role 'network_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
