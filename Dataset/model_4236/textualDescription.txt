An association connects 'chartDsl_Project' and 'chartDsl_Company'. From 'chartDsl_Project', the role 'chartDsl_Project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'chartDsl_Company', the role 'chartDsl_Company2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'chartDsl_Project' and 'chartDsl_Task'. From 'chartDsl_Project', the role 'chartDsl_Project4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'chartDsl_Task', the role 'chartDsl_Task' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'chartDsl_Employee' and 'chartDsl_Task'. From 'chartDsl_Employee', the role 'chartDsl_Employee7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'chartDsl_Task', the role 'chartDsl_Task6' has cardinality 0..*.
