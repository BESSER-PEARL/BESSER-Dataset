The domain model 'kiamacs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'kiamacs_BaseCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BaseCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kiamacs_NumCS' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'kiamacs_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kiamacs_NodeCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NodeCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kiamacs_TopCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kiamacs_PlusCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'kiamacs_TopCS' is a specialization of 'BaseCS'.
The class 'kiamacs_NodeCS' is a specialization of 'BaseCS'.
The class 'kiamacs_PlusCS' is a specialization of 'NodeCS'.
The class 'kiamacs_NumCS' is a specialization of 'NodeCS'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'kiamacs_NodeCS' and 'kiamacs_TopCS'. From 'kiamacs_NodeCS', the role 'kiamacs_NodeCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kiamacs_TopCS', the role 'kiamacs_TopCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kiamacs_PlusCS' and 'kiamacs_NodeCS'. From 'kiamacs_PlusCS', the role 'kiamacs_PlusCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kiamacs_NodeCS', the role 'kiamacs_NodeCS2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kiamacs_NodeCS' and 'kiamacs_PlusCS'. From 'kiamacs_NodeCS', the role 'kiamacs_NodeCS5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kiamacs_PlusCS', the role 'kiamacs_PlusCS4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kiamacs_BaseCS' and 'kiamacs_EObject'. From 'kiamacs_BaseCS', the role 'kiamacs_BaseCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kiamacs_EObject', the role 'kiamacs_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
