The domain model 'FeatureModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'FeatureModel_RootFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'ConfigConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_And' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_FeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_Or' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'FeatureModel_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_Xor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureModel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'kind' defines the following possible values: 'optional', 'mandatory'.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'exclude', 'require'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'FeatureModel_And' is a specialization of 'ConfigConstraint'.
The class 'FeatureModel_Or' is a specialization of 'ConfigConstraint'.
The class 'FeatureModel_Xor' is a specialization of 'ConfigConstraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'FeatureModel_FeatureModel' and 'FeatureModel_RootFeature'. From 'FeatureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'FeatureModel_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FeatureModel_RootFeature', the role 'FeatureModel_RootFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint' and 'FeatureModel_FeatureModel'. From 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint', the role 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FeatureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'FeatureModel_FeatureModel2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint' and 'FeatureModel_RootFeature'. From 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint', the role 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FeatureModel_RootFeature', the role 'FeatureModel_RootFeature4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FeatureModel_Feature' and 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint'. From 'FeatureModel_Feature', the role 'FeatureModel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint', the role 'FeatureModel_FeatureConstraint6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FeatureModel_Feature' and 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint'. From 'FeatureModel_Feature', the role 'ConfFeatures' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint', the role 'ConfigConstraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint' and 'FeatureModel_Feature'. From 'FeatureModel_ConfigConstraint', the role 'Config' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FeatureModel_Feature', the role 'Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
