The domain model 'type' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'text', which is of type str; 'mixed', which is of type str; 'cDATA', which is of type str.

'AnyType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'type_SimpleAnyType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'rawValue', which is of type str.

'type_EDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'type_AnyType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mixed', which is of type str; 'anyAttribute', which is of type str; 'any', which is of type str.

'type_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'type_ProcessingInstruction' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'target', which is of type str; 'data', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'type_SimpleAnyType' is a specialization of 'AnyType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'type_EDataType' and 'type_SimpleAnyType'. From 'type_EDataType', the role 'type_EDataType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'type_SimpleAnyType', the role 'type_SimpleAnyType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot' and 'type_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot', the role 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'type_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'type_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot' and 'type_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot', the role 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'type_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'type_EStringToStringMapEntry4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'type_ProcessingInstruction' and 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot'. From 'type_ProcessingInstruction', the role 'type_ProcessingInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot', the role 'type_XMLTypeDocumentRoot6' has cardinality 0..*.
