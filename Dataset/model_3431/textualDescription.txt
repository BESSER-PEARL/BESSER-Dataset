The domain model 'myDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'myDsl_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDsl_School' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl_Student' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'myDsl_Teacher' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_SchoolModel' and 'myDsl_School'. From 'myDsl_SchoolModel', the role 'myDsl_SchoolModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_School', the role 'myDsl_School' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_School' and 'myDsl_Person'. From 'myDsl_School', the role 'myDsl_School2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Person', the role 'myDsl_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Student' and 'myDsl_Teacher'. From 'myDsl_Student', the role 'myDsl_Student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Teacher', the role 'myDsl_Teacher' has cardinality 0..*.
