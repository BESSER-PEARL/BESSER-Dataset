Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BookCategory' defines the following possible values: 'Mystery', 'ScienceFiction', 'Biography'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'Library_CirculatingItem' is a specialization of 'Lendable'.
The class 'Library_Periodical' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'Library_AudioVisualItem' is a specialization of 'CirculatingItem'.
The class 'Library_BookOnTape' is a specialization of 'AudioVisualItem'.
The class 'Library_VideoCassette' is a specialization of 'AudioVisualItem'.
The class 'Library_Borrower' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'Library_Person' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'Library_Employee' is a specialization of 'Person'.
