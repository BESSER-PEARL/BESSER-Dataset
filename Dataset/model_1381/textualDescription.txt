The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'statemachine_Pseudostate' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'kind', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_LabeledTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_ComplexState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Region' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PseudostateKind' defines the following possible values: 'final', 'initial'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statemachine_State' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'statemachine_Pseudostate' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'statemachine_ComplexState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statemachine_Statemachine' is a specialization of 'Region'.
The class 'statemachine_LabeledTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_Vertex'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Vertex', the role 'statemachine_Vertex' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_ComplexState' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_ComplexState', the role 'statemachine_ComplexState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_ComplexState' and 'statemachine_Region'. From 'statemachine_ComplexState', the role 'statemachine_ComplexState3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Region', the role 'statemachine_Region' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_Vertex'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Vertex', the role 'statemachine_Vertex6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Vertex' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_Vertex', the role 'statemachine_Vertex9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_Statemachine'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Statemachine', the role 'statemachine_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Action' and 'statemachine_Statemachine'. From 'statemachine_Action', the role 'statemachine_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Statemachine', the role 'statemachine_Statemachine13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Region' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Region', the role 'statemachine_Region15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Pseudostate' and 'statemachine_Region'. From 'statemachine_Pseudostate', the role 'statemachine_Pseudostate' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Region', the role 'statemachine_Region18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Action' and 'statemachine_LabeledTransition'. From 'statemachine_Action', the role 'statemachine_Action20' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_LabeledTransition', the role 'statemachine_LabeledTransition' has cardinality 0..*.
