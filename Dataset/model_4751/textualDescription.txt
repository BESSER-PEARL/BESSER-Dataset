The domain model 'edd' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'edd_Block' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'edd_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'edd_TreeElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'index', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'edd_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'edd_Model' and 'edd_Diagram'. From 'edd_Model', the role 'edd_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'edd_Diagram', the role 'edd_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'edd_Model' and 'edd_Block'. From 'edd_Model', the role 'edd_Model2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'edd_Block', the role 'edd_Block' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'edd_TreeElement' and 'edd_TreeElement'. From 'edd_TreeElement', the role 'edd_TreeElement3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'edd_TreeElement', the role 'edd_TreeElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'edd_Block' and 'edd_TreeElement'. From 'edd_Block', the role 'edd_Block6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'edd_TreeElement', the role 'edd_TreeElement7' has cardinality 0..*.
