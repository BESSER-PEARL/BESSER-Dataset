The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'trace_EAttribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_ReferenceMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EReference' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EStructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_AttributeMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_ClassMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ReferenceMappingType' defines the following possible values: 'TRANSLATED', 'NONE', 'MAPPED'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_ClassMapping'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_ClassMapping', the role 'trace_ClassMapping' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_AttributeMapping'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_AttributeMapping', the role 'trace_AttributeMapping' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_ReferenceMapping'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_ReferenceMapping', the role 'trace_ReferenceMapping' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_ClassMapping' and 'trace_EClass'. From 'trace_ClassMapping', the role 'trace_ClassMapping6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_EClass', the role 'trace_EClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_ClassMapping' and 'trace_EClass'. From 'trace_ClassMapping', the role 'trace_ClassMapping8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_EClass', the role 'trace_EClass9' has cardinality 0..*.
