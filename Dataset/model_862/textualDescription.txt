The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'event', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Machine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Machine'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Machine', the role 'owning' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_Machine'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Machine', the role 'owning2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Machine'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'states' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Machine', the role 'Machine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_Machine'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'transitions' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Machine', the role 'Machine9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'State11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'State13' has cardinality 0..*.
