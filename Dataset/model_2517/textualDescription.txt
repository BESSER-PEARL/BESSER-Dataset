The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model6_ReferenceObject' is a specialization of 'BaseObject'.
The class 'model6_ContainmentObject' is a specialization of 'BaseObject'.
The class 'model6_Holder' is a specialization of 'Holdable'.
The class 'model6_Thing' is a specialization of 'Holdable'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
