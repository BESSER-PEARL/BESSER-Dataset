The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'database_Table' is a specialization of 'RefTable'.
The class 'database_FKey' is a specialization of 'RefFKey'.
The class 'database_Column' is a specialization of 'RefColumn'.
The class 'database_Database' is a specialization of 'RefDatabase'.
The class 'database_Procedure' is a specialization of 'RefProcedure'.
The class 'database_Parameter' is a specialization of 'RefParameter'.
The class 'database_Type' is a specialization of 'RefType'.
The class 'database_PKey' is a specialization of 'RefPKey'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'database_RefColumn' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_RefColumn', the role 'database_RefColumn' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_RefPKey' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_RefPKey', the role 'database_RefPKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_RefFKey'. From 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_RefFKey', the role 'database_RefFKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_FKey' and 'database_Column'. From 'database_FKey', the role 'database_FKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Column', the role 'database_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_RefTable' and 'database_FKey'. From 'database_RefTable', the role 'database_RefTable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_FKey', the role 'database_FKey7' has cardinality 0..*.
