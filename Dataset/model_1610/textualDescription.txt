The domain model 'pnml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pnml_PNMLDocument' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'location', which is of type str.

'pnml_NetElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'pnml_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'location', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pnml_TransitionElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'pnml_ArcTransition2Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pnml_PlaceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'tokens', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pnml_PlaceElement' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'pnml_TransitionElement' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'pnml_NetElement' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pnml_NetElement' and 'pnml_PNMLDocument'. From 'pnml_NetElement', the role 'pnml_NetElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pnml_PNMLDocument', the role 'pnml_PNMLDocument' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pnml_PlaceElement' and 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition'. From 'pnml_PlaceElement', the role 'pnml_PlaceElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition', the role 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition' and 'pnml_TransitionElement'. From 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition', the role 'pnml_ArcPlace2Transition3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pnml_TransitionElement', the role 'pnml_TransitionElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pnml_PlaceElement' and 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place'. From 'pnml_PlaceElement', the role 'pnml_PlaceElement5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place', the role 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place' and 'pnml_TransitionElement'. From 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place', the role 'pnml_ArcTransition2Place7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pnml_TransitionElement', the role 'pnml_TransitionElement8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pnml_NetElement' and 'pnml_Element'. From 'pnml_NetElement', the role 'pnml_NetElement10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pnml_Element', the role 'pnml_Element' has cardinality 0..*.
