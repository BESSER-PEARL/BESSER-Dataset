The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractNamedObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_AbstractNamedObject' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graph_Graph' is a specialization of 'AbstractNamedObject'.
The class 'graph_Node' is a specialization of 'AbstractNamedObject'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph_Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'Edge3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'outgoingEdges' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'Node6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'incomingEdges' has cardinality 0..*.
