The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'model_TargetObject' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'singleAttribute', which is of type str; 'arrayAttribute', which is of type str.

'model_ETypes' represents an important domain concept.
