Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FeatureType' defines the following possible values: 'OPTIONAL', 'SIMPLE', 'MANDATORY'.
The enumeration 'FeatureGroupType' defines the following possible values: 'ORGROUP', 'XORGROUP', 'SIMPLEGROUP'.
The enumeration 'ValueType' defines the following possible values: 'FEATURE', 'STRING', 'FLOAT', 'INTEGER', 'NONE'.
The enumeration 'ConfigState' defines the following possible values: 'USER_ELIMINATED', 'UNDECIDED', 'USER_SELECTED'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'specializationModel_Feature' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'specializationModel_FeatureGroup' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'specializationModel_RelationFG' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'specializationModel_RelationFeature' is a specialization of 'Relation'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
