The model defines 4 main class(es).

'stateChart_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'metadata', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'stateChart_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'TE', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'metadata', which is of type str.

'stateChart_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'stateChart_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'metadata', which is of type str; 'actions', which is of type str; 'label', which is of type str; 'activity', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
