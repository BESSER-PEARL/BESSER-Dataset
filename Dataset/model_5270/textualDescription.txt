The domain model 'clazz' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'clazz_BRef' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'clazz_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'clazz_Annotation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tag', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'clazz_B' and 'clazz_Annotation'. From 'clazz_B', the role 'clazz_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'clazz_Annotation', the role 'clazz_Annotation' has cardinality 0..*.
