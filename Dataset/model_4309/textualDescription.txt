The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metricDSL_ExternalMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.
The class 'metricDSL_InternalMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.
The class 'metricDSL_Parameter' is a specialization of 'Number'.
The class 'metricDSL_Constant' is a specialization of 'Number'.
The class 'metricDSL_WeightedMetric' is a specialization of 'MetricDefinition'.
The class 'metricDSL_StepwiseMetric' is a specialization of 'MetricDefinition'.
The class 'metricDSL_RatioMetric' is a specialization of 'MetricDefinition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
