Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Subject' defines the following possible values: 'MechanicalEngineering', 'BusinessEngineering', 'AppliedGeographics', 'Physics', 'CES', 'Mathematics', 'ComputerScience'.
The enumeration 'Gender' defines the following possible values: 'Female', 'Male'.
The enumeration 'Nationality' defines the following possible values: 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'German', 'other'.
The enumeration 'ProgrammingLanguage' defines the following possible values: 'C_CPP', 'Java', 'other', 'Pascal_Delphi'.
The enumeration 'OperatingSystem' defines the following possible values: 'MacOS', 'other', 'Windows', 'Linux_Unix'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'VorkursModel_Student' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_RegistrationSystem' and 'VorkursModel_Student'. From 'VorkursModel_RegistrationSystem', the role 'VorkursModel_RegistrationSystem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_Student', the role 'VorkursModel_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant' and 'VorkursModel_RegistrationSystem'. From 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant', the role 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_RegistrationSystem', the role 'VorkursModel_RegistrationSystem2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_Contact' and 'VorkursModel_Person'. From 'VorkursModel_Contact', the role 'VorkursModel_Contact' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_Person', the role 'VorkursModel_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_Person' and 'VorkursModel_Notebook'. From 'VorkursModel_Person', the role 'VorkursModel_Person5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_Notebook', the role 'VorkursModel_Notebook' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_Person' and 'VorkursModel_Qualification'. From 'VorkursModel_Person', the role 'VorkursModel_Person7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_Qualification', the role 'VorkursModel_Qualification' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_Contact' and 'VorkursModel_Address'. From 'VorkursModel_Contact', the role 'VorkursModel_Contact9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_Address', the role 'VorkursModel_Address' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'VorkursModel_Room' and 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant'. From 'VorkursModel_Room', the role 'VorkursModel_Room' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant', the role 'VorkursModel_TeachingAssistant11' has cardinality 0..*.
