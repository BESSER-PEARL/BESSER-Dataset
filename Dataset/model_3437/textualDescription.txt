The domain model 'school' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'school_Classroom' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'teacher', which is of type str; 'capacity', which is of type int; 'rank', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'school_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nickname', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'age', which is of type int.

'school_School' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'director', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'city', which is of type str; 'zipCode', which is of type str.

'school_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'school_Classroom' and 'school_Student'. From 'school_Classroom', the role 'school_Classroom' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_School' and 'school_Diagram'. From 'school_School', the role 'school_School' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Diagram', the role 'school_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Classroom' and 'school_School'. From 'school_Classroom', the role 'school_Classroom4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_School', the role 'school_School3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Student' and 'school_Student'. From 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student7' has cardinality 0..*.
