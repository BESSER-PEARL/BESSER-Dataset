The domain model 'TestMM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'TestMM_Metadata' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'taglist', which is of type str; 'user', which is of type str; 'date', which is of type str; 'webpage', which is of type str.

'TestMM_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'xpath', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'TestMM_Test' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ActionType' defines the following possible values: 'click', 'comment', 'insert', 'copy'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TestMM_Metadata' and 'TestMM_Test'. From 'TestMM_Metadata', the role 'Metadata' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TestMM_Test', the role 'te' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TestMM_Action' and 'TestMM_Test'. From 'TestMM_Action', the role 'Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TestMM_Test', the role 'te2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TestMM_Metadata' and 'TestMM_Test'. From 'TestMM_Metadata', the role 'md' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TestMM_Test', the role 'Test' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TestMM_Test' and 'TestMM_Action'. From 'TestMM_Test', the role 'Test5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TestMM_Action', the role 'act' has cardinality 0..*.
