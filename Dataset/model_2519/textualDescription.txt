The domain model 'ext' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'ext_F' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ext_ExtE' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ext_ExtE' is a specialization of 'E'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ext_F' and 'ext_ExtE'. From 'ext_F', the role 'F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ext_ExtE', the role 'e' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ext_F' and 'ext_ExtE'. From 'ext_F', the role 'f' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ext_ExtE', the role 'ExtE' has cardinality 0..*.
