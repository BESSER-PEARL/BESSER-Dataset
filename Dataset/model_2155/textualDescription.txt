The domain model 'SkillGraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'SkillGraph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SkillGraph_Requirement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'term', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str.

'SkillGraph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SkillGraph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'programPath', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'category', which is of type str.

'SkillGraph_Equation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'equation', which is of type str.

'SkillGraph_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'variable', which is of type bool; 'defaultValue', which is of type str; 'abbreviation', which is of type str; 'unit', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'Technical_Safety_Requirement', 'Technical_Requirement', 'Functional_Safety_Requirement'.
The enumeration 'Category' defines the following possible values: 'planning', 'actuator', 'perception', 'observable_external_behavior', 'action', 'sensor', 'main'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
