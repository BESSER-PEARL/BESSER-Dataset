The domain model 'mngr' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'mngr_ManagedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

'mngr_ManagerState' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Prob', which is of type float; 'isStart', which is of type bool; 'isEnd', which is of type bool.

'mngr_Manager' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mngr_ManagerTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'output', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str; 'Event', which is of type str; 'Action', which is of type str; 'transProb', which is of type float; 'transRate', which is of type float; 'Condition', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mngr_OpaqueExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mngr_ManagerParameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'LitteralBoolean', which is of type bool; 'LitteralInteger', which is of type int; 'LitteralString', which is of type str; 'isInput', which is of type bool; 'LitteralUnlimitedNatural', which is of type float.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mngr_Manager' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mngr_ManagerState' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mngr_ManagerTransition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mngr_ManagerParameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'mngr_ManagedElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
