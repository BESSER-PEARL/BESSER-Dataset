The domain model 'abc' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'abc_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'abc_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'abc_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'abc_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'abc_A' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'abc_B' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'abc_C' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'abc_A' and 'abc_C'. From 'abc_A', the role 'abc_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abc_C', the role 'abc_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abc_C' and 'abc_B'. From 'abc_C', the role 'abc_C2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abc_B', the role 'abc_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abc_B' and 'abc_A'. From 'abc_B', the role 'abc_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abc_A', the role 'abc_A5' has cardinality 0..*.
