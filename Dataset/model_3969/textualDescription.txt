The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'standard_Document' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'standard_Executable' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'standard_Library' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'standard_Script' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'standard_Source' is a specialization of 'File'.
