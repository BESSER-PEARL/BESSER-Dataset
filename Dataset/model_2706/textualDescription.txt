The domain model 'pgohttpestest' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'pgohttpestest_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pgohttpestest_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pgohttpestest_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'priv1', which is of type int.

'pgohttpestest_Priv' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'pgohttpestest_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'pgohttpestest_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pgohttpestest_D' is a specialization of 'C'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pgohttpestest_A' and 'pgohttpestest_Root'. From 'pgohttpestest_A', the role 'pgohttpestest_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pgohttpestest_Root', the role 'pgohttpestest_Root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pgohttpestest_B' and 'pgohttpestest_Root'. From 'pgohttpestest_B', the role 'pgohttpestest_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pgohttpestest_Root', the role 'pgohttpestest_Root2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pgohttpestest_B' and 'pgohttpestest_C'. From 'pgohttpestest_B', the role 'pgohttpestest_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pgohttpestest_C', the role 'pgohttpestest_C' has cardinality 0..*.
