The domain model 'typeA' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'typeA_BlockA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeA_PortA' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'typeA_BlockA' and 'typeA_PortA'. From 'typeA_BlockA', the role 'typeA_BlockA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeA_PortA', the role 'typeA_PortA' has cardinality 0..*.
