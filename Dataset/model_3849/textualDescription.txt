The domain model 'SimpleRDBMS' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'SimpleRDBMS_FKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Column' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleRDBMS_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'FKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleRDBMS_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'tipo', which is of type str.

'Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'FKey' and 'SimpleRDBMS_Table'. From 'FKey', the role 'FKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Column' and 'SimpleRDBMS_Table'. From 'Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleRDBMS_Table' and 'Column'. From 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Column', the role 'Column5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Table' and 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey'. From 'Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Column' and 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey'. From 'Column', the role 'Column9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey8' has cardinality 0..*.
