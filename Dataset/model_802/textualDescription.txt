The domain model 'k3fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'k3fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'output', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'k3fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'k3fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'consummedString', which is of type str; 'producedString', which is of type str; 'unprocessedString', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'k3fsm_State' and 'k3fsm_FSM'. From 'k3fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'k3fsm_FSM', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'k3fsm_FSM' and 'k3fsm_State'. From 'k3fsm_FSM', the role 'k3fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'k3fsm_State', the role 'k3fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'k3fsm_FSM' and 'k3fsm_State'. From 'k3fsm_FSM', the role 'k3fsm_FSM4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'k3fsm_State', the role 'k3fsm_State5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'k3fsm_State' and 'k3fsm_FSM'. From 'k3fsm_State', the role 'k3fsm_State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'k3fsm_FSM', the role 'k3fsm_FSM7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'k3fsm_State' and 'k3fsm_Transition'. From 'k3fsm_State', the role '10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'k3fsm_Transition', the role '11' has cardinality 0..*.
