The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'l2_Document' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'l2_Executable' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'l2_Library' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'l2_Script' is a specialization of 'File'.
The class 'l2_Source' is a specialization of 'File'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
