The domain model 'classescs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'classescs_NamedElementCS' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classescs_RootCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classescs_ClassCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classescs_PathElementCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classescs_PackageCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElementCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classescs_PathNameCS' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classescs_PackageCS' is a specialization of 'NamedElementCS'.
The class 'classescs_ClassCS' is a specialization of 'NamedElementCS'.
The class 'classescs_PathElementCS' is a specialization of 'NamedElementCS'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classescs_ClassCS' and 'classescs_PackageCS'. From 'classescs_ClassCS', the role 'classescs_ClassCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classescs_PackageCS', the role 'classescs_PackageCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classescs_PathNameCS' and 'classescs_ClassCS'. From 'classescs_PathNameCS', the role 'classescs_PathNameCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classescs_ClassCS', the role 'classescs_ClassCS2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classescs_PathNameCS' and 'classescs_PathElementCS'. From 'classescs_PathNameCS', the role 'classescs_PathNameCS4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classescs_PathElementCS', the role 'classescs_PathElementCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classescs_PackageCS' and 'classescs_RootCS'. From 'classescs_PackageCS', the role 'classescs_PackageCS6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classescs_RootCS', the role 'classescs_RootCS' has cardinality 0..*.
