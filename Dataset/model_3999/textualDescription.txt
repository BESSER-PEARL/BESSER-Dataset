The domain model 'classes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'classes_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isMany', which is of type bool.

'classes_CClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'abstract', which is of type bool.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_Datatype' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classes_TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_CModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classes_Classifier' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classes_CClass' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'classes_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classes_Attribute' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'classes_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classes_Classifier' and 'classes_CModel'. From 'classes_Classifier', the role 'classes_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_CModel', the role 'classes_CModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_CClass' and 'classes_CClass'. From 'classes_CClass', the role 'classes_CClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_CClass', the role 'classes_CClass1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_CClass' and 'classes_Attribute'. From 'classes_CClass', the role 'classes_CClass4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Attribute', the role 'classes_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_CClass' and 'classes_CClass'. From 'classes_CClass', the role 'classes_CClass5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_CClass', the role 'classes_CClass7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Classifier' and 'classes_TypedElement'. From 'classes_Classifier', the role 'classes_Classifier9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_TypedElement', the role 'classes_TypedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
