'trace_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_Trace'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_EObject' and 'trace_Trace'. From 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_EObject'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject6' has cardinality 0..*.
