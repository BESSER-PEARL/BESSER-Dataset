Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TaskState' defines the following possible values: 'NOT_STARTED', 'WAITING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'DONE'.
The enumeration 'DroneState' defines the following possible values: 'DONE', 'HOVERING', 'MOVING', 'CREATED'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dronesSimulation_ObstacleObservation' is a specialization of 'Observation'.
The class 'dronesSimulation_DroneObservation' is a specialization of 'Observation'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
