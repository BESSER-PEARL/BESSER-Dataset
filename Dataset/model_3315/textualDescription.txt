The domain model 'traceability' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'traceability_CyberPhysicalSystem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traceability_CPSToDeployment' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traceability_Identifiable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traceability_Deployment' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traceability_DeploymentElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'traceability_CyberPhysicalSystem' and 'traceability_CPSToDeployment'. From 'traceability_CyberPhysicalSystem', the role 'traceability_CyberPhysicalSystem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traceability_CPSToDeployment', the role 'traceability_CPSToDeployment' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'traceability_CPSToDeployment' and 'traceability_Deployment'. From 'traceability_CPSToDeployment', the role 'traceability_CPSToDeployment2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traceability_Deployment', the role 'traceability_Deployment' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace' and 'traceability_CPSToDeployment'. From 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace', the role 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traceability_CPSToDeployment', the role 'traceability_CPSToDeployment4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace' and 'traceability_Identifiable'. From 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace', the role 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traceability_Identifiable', the role 'traceability_Identifiable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace' and 'traceability_DeploymentElement'. From 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace', the role 'traceability_CPS2DeplyomentTrace8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traceability_DeploymentElement', the role 'traceability_DeploymentElement' has cardinality 0..*.
