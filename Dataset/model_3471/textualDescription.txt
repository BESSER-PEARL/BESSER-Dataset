Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AggregationRules' defines the following possible values: 'Sum', 'Minimum', 'AtLeastOnce', 'Maximum', 'Product'.
The enumeration 'FeatureTypes' defines the following possible values: 'GroupingFeature', 'AbstractFeature', 'InstanceFeature'.
The enumeration 'AttributeDomain' defines the following possible values: 'Boolean', 'Continuous'.
The enumeration 'ScaleOrders' defines the following possible values: 'LowerIsBetter', 'HigherIsBetter', 'ExistenceIsBetter'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'servicefeaturemodel_OptionalServiceFeature' is a specialization of 'ServiceFeature'.
The class 'servicefeaturemodel_OR' is a specialization of 'GroupRelationship'.
The class 'servicefeaturemodel_XOR' is a specialization of 'GroupRelationship'.
The class 'servicefeaturemodel_MandatoryServiceFeature' is a specialization of 'ServiceFeature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
