Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ElemType' defines the following possible values: 'graph', 'node', 'edge'.
The enumeration 'AttrType' defines the following possible values: 'boolean', 'double', 'string', 'integer'.
The enumeration 'EdgeType' defines the following possible values: 'undirected', 'directed'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'GraphML_Root' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'GraphML_Element' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'GraphML_Key' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'GraphML_Graph' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'GraphML_Edge' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'GraphML_HyperEdge' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'GraphML_Node' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'GraphML_Port' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'GraphML_EndPoint' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'GraphML_Data' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Key' and 'GraphML_Root'. From 'Key', the role 'Key' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphML_Root', the role 'GraphML_Root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Graph' and 'GraphML_Root'. From 'Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphML_Root', the role 'GraphML_Root2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphML_Element' and 'Data'. From 'GraphML_Element', the role 'GraphML_Element' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Data', the role 'Data' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphML_Element' and 'Graph'. From 'GraphML_Element', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphML_Graph' and 'Element'. From 'GraphML_Graph', the role '06' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Element', the role '#7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Node' and 'GraphML_Edge'. From 'Node', the role '#10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphML_Edge', the role '09' has cardinality 0..*.
