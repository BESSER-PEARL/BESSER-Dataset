The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'services_CFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.
The class 'services_RFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'services_EObject' and 'services_CFSService'. From 'services_EObject', the role 'services_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'services_CFSService', the role 'services_CFSService' has cardinality 0..*.
