The domain model 'Graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'Graph_GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'label', which is of type str; 'color', which is of type str.

'Graph_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Graph_DirectedArc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'weight', which is of type int.

'GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'shape', which is of type str; 'style', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Graph_Graph' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'Graph_GraphElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'Graph_Node' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'Graph_DirectedArc' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Graph_GraphElement' and 'Graph_Graph'. From 'Graph_GraphElement', the role 'GraphElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph_Graph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Graph_Graph' and 'Graph_GraphElement'. From 'Graph_Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph_GraphElement', the role 'contents' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Graph_DirectedArc' and 'Graph_Node'. From 'Graph_DirectedArc', the role 'Graph_DirectedArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph_Node', the role 'Graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Graph_DirectedArc' and 'Graph_Node'. From 'Graph_DirectedArc', the role 'Graph_DirectedArc4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph_Node', the role 'Graph_Node5' has cardinality 0..*.
