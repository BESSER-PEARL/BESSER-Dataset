The domain model 'sgen' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 18 main class(es).

'sgen_Literal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_IntLiteral' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'sgen_FeatureTypeLibrary' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Literal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_DeprecatableElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'deprecated', which is of type bool.

'sgen_RealLiteral' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type float.

'sgen_GeneratorEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'contentType', which is of type str.

'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_FeatureConfiguration' represents an important domain concept.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ParameterTypes' defines the following possible values: 'FLOAT', 'BOOLEAN', 'INTEGER', 'STRING'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sgen_FeatureType' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sgen_FeatureType' is a specialization of 'DeprecatableElement'.
The class 'sgen_FeatureParameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sgen_FeatureParameter' is a specialization of 'DeprecatableElement'.
The class 'sgen_BoolLiteral' is a specialization of 'Literal'.
The class 'sgen_IntLiteral' is a specialization of 'Literal'.
The class 'sgen_RealLiteral' is a specialization of 'Literal'.
The class 'sgen_StringLiteral' is a specialization of 'Literal'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sgen_GeneratorEntry' and 'sgen_GeneratorModel'. From 'sgen_GeneratorEntry', the role 'sgen_GeneratorEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sgen_GeneratorModel', the role 'sgen_GeneratorModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration' and 'sgen_FeatureConfiguration'. From 'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration', the role 'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sgen_FeatureConfiguration', the role 'sgen_FeatureConfiguration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sgen_FeatureParameter' and 'sgen_FeatureType'. From 'sgen_FeatureParameter', the role 'FeatureParameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sgen_FeatureType', the role 'featureType' has cardinality 0..*.
