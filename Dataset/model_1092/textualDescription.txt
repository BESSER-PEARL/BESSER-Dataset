The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petrinet_ArcSortant' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petrinet_ReadArc' is a specialization of 'ArcSortant'.
The class 'petrinet_ArcEntrant' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_Transition' and 'petrinet_ArcSortant'. From 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'successeur' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_ArcSortant', the role 'ArcSortant' has cardinality 0..*.
