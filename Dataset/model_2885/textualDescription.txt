The domain model 'metamodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'metamodel_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metamodel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mappedBy', which is of type str; 'annotation', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'metamodel_Query' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'queryString', which is of type str; 'methodName', which is of type str.

'metamodel_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metamodel_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metamodel_parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'metamodel_Datatype' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Annotation' defines the following possible values: 'OneToMany', 'ManyToOne', 'Id', 'ManyToMany', 'OneToOne', 'None', 'ManyToManyMapped'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metamodel_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'metamodel_Model' and 'metamodel_Type'. From 'metamodel_Model', the role 'metamodel_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Type', the role 'metamodel_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Entity' and 'metamodel_Feature'. From 'metamodel_Entity', the role 'metamodel_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Feature', the role 'metamodel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Entity' and 'metamodel_Query'. From 'metamodel_Entity', the role 'metamodel_Entity3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Query', the role 'metamodel_Query' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Type' and 'metamodel_Feature'. From 'metamodel_Type', the role 'metamodel_Type6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Feature', the role 'metamodel_Feature5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Query' and 'metamodel_Entity'. From 'metamodel_Query', the role 'metamodel_Query8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Entity', the role 'metamodel_Entity9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_parameter' and 'metamodel_Query'. From 'metamodel_parameter', the role 'metamodel_parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Query', the role 'metamodel_Query11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Type' and 'metamodel_parameter'. From 'metamodel_Type', the role 'metamodel_Type14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_parameter', the role 'metamodel_parameter13' has cardinality 0..*.
