Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Main' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_Main', the role 'mindstorms_Main' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Block' and 'mindstorms_BlockContainer'. From 'mindstorms_Block', the role 'mindstorms_Block' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_BlockContainer', the role 'mindstorms_BlockContainer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Behavior' and 'mindstorms_Arbitrator'. From 'mindstorms_Behavior', the role 'mindstorms_Behavior' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Arbitrator', the role 'mindstorms_Arbitrator' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Arbitrator' and 'mindstorms_Behavior'. From 'mindstorms_Arbitrator', the role 'mindstorms_Arbitrator4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Behavior', the role 'mindstorms_Behavior5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Instruction' and 'mindstorms_ReuseInstruction'. From 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_ReuseInstruction', the role 'mindstorms_ReuseInstruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_ConditionContainer' and 'mindstorms_Condition'. From 'mindstorms_ConditionContainer', the role 'mindstorms_ConditionContainer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Condition', the role 'mindstorms_Condition' has cardinality 0..*.
