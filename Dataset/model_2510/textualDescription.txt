The domain model 'rootPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'rootPackage_aSubSubPackage_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rootPackage_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'bint', which is of type int; 'stuff', which is of type str.

'aSubSubPackage_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rootPackage_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'a2', which is of type bool; 'a', which is of type int.

'rootPackage_AbstractA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rootPackage_aSubSubPackage_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rootPackage_aSubPackage_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'd', which is of type int.

'rootPackage_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'cstring', which is of type str.

'AbstractA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'rootPackage_A' is a specialization of 'AbstractA'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rootPackage_A' and 'rootPackage_C'. From 'rootPackage_A', the role 'rootPackage_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rootPackage_C', the role 'rootPackage_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rootPackage_A' and 'rootPackage_B'. From 'rootPackage_A', the role 'rootPackage_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rootPackage_B', the role 'rootPackage_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rootPackage_C' and 'rootPackage_B'. From 'rootPackage_C', the role 'C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rootPackage_B', the role 'b' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rootPackage_C' and 'rootPackage_B'. From 'rootPackage_C', the role 'c' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rootPackage_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'aSubSubPackage_F' and 'rootPackage_aSubSubPackage_E'. From 'aSubSubPackage_F', the role 'aSubSubPackage_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rootPackage_aSubSubPackage_E', the role 'rootPackage_aSubSubPackage_E' has cardinality 0..*.
