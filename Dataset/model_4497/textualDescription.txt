The domain model 'ArduinoCard' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'ArduinoCard_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ArduinoCard_Block' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'pinNumber', which is of type int; 'isAnalogic', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'ArduinoCard_Actuator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ArduinoCard_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ArduinoCard_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Block' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ArduinoCard_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isInitial', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'ArduinoCard_Card' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BlockInteraction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ArduinoCard_BlockInteraction' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isHigh', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'ArduinoCard_Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ArduinoCard_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Block'.
The class 'ArduinoCard_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Block'.
The class 'ArduinoCard_Condition' is a specialization of 'BlockInteraction'.
The class 'ArduinoCard_Command' is a specialization of 'BlockInteraction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ArduinoCard_Transition' and 'ArduinoCard_State'. From 'ArduinoCard_Transition', the role 'ArduinoCard_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ArduinoCard_State', the role 'ArduinoCard_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ArduinoCard_State' and 'ArduinoCard_Command'. From 'ArduinoCard_State', the role 'ArduinoCard_State2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ArduinoCard_Command', the role 'ArduinoCard_Command' has cardinality 0..*.
