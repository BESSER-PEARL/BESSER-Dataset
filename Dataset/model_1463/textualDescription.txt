The domain model 'MetaModelGraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'MetaModelGraph_Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MetaModelGraph_Composition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MetaModelGraph_SubGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'amountOfParentAbstractEClass', which is of type int; 'amountOfRecursionPackages', which is of type int; 'amountOfAbstractEClass', which is of type int; 'amountOfParentEClass', which is of type int; 'height', which is of type int; 'amountEClassesOut', which is of type int; 'amountOfConcreteEClass', which is of type int; 'amountUnits', which is of type int; 'amountRecursionUnits', which is of type int; 'amountPackages', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EnumModular' defines the following possible values: 'AbstractPackage', 'RecursionAbstractUnit', 'Default', 'RecursionUnit', 'InsideProject', 'RecursionPackage', 'AbstractUnit', 'Project', 'AbstractPackageUnit', 'Unit', 'Package', 'InsidePackage', 'RecursionAbstractPackage', 'InsideUnit'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'MetaModelGraph_Composition' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'MetaModelGraph_Reference' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'MetaModelGraph_SubClass' is a specialization of 'Relation'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
