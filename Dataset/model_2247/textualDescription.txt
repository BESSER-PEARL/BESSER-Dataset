The domain model 'tdt4250' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'tdt4250_CourseGroup' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tdt4250_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'study_points', which is of type float; 'semester', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str; 'level', which is of type str.

'tdt4250_StudyProgram' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'number_of_semesters', which is of type int.

'tdt4250_Specialisation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tdt4250_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'studentID', which is of type int; 'current_semester', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Semester' defines the following possible values: 'spring', 'autumn'.
The enumeration 'StudyProgramName' defines the following possible values: 'computer_science_5_years', 'informatics', 'computer_science_2_years'.
