The domain model 'mathCompiler' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'mathCompiler_External' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'exponent', which is of type int; 'base', which is of type int.

'mathCompiler_Var' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'mathCompiler_Let' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'mathCompiler_Expressions' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathCompiler_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathCompiler_Num' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'mathCompiler_Mult' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathCompiler_MathExp' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'line', which is of type str.

'mathCompiler_Div' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathCompiler_Plus' represents an important domain concept.

'mathCompiler_Minus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mathCompiler_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_Minus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_Mult' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_Div' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_External' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_Var' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_Let' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathCompiler_Num' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
