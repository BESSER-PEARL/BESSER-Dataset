The domain model 'esm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'esm_Machine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'esm_EndState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'esm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'esm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'action', which is of type str.

'esm_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'esm_EndState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'esm_Machine' and 'esm_State'. From 'esm_Machine', the role 'esm_Machine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_State', the role 'esm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_Transition' and 'esm_Machine'. From 'esm_Transition', the role 'esm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_Machine', the role 'esm_Machine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_State' and 'esm_Transition'. From 'esm_State', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_Transition' and 'esm_State'. From 'esm_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_State', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_EObject' and 'esm_Transition'. From 'esm_EObject', the role 'esm_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_Transition', the role 'esm_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_Transition' and 'esm_State'. From 'esm_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'esm_Transition' and 'esm_State'. From 'esm_Transition', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'esm_State', the role 'State10' has cardinality 0..*.
