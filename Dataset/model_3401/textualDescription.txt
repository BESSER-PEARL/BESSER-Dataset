Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'training_Training' and 'training_Session'. From 'training_Training', the role 'training_Training' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Trainer' and 'training_Session'. From 'training_Trainer', the role 'training_Trainer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Person' and 'training_Session'. From 'training_Person', the role 'training_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_Person' and 'training_TrainingOrganization'. From 'training_Person', the role 'training_Person6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_TrainingOrganization', the role 'training_TrainingOrganization' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_TrainingOrganization' and 'training_Session'. From 'training_TrainingOrganization', the role 'training_TrainingOrganization8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Session', the role 'training_Session9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'training_TrainingOrganization' and 'training_Training'. From 'training_TrainingOrganization', the role 'training_TrainingOrganization11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'training_Training', the role 'training_Training12' has cardinality 0..*.
