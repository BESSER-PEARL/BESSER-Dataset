An association connects 'library_CityLibrary' and 'library_Customer'. From 'library_CityLibrary', the role 'library_CityLibrary' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Customer', the role 'library_Customer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Customer' and 'library_Borrowable'. From 'library_Customer', the role 'library_Customer3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Borrowable', the role 'library_Borrowable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_CityLibrary' and 'library_Borrowable'. From 'library_CityLibrary', the role 'CityLibrary' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Borrowable', the role 'borrowables' has cardinality 0..*.
