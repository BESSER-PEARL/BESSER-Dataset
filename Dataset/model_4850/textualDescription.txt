Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Color' defines the following possible values: 'Black', 'Green', 'Red', 'Grey', 'White'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'aml_MinMax' is a specialization of 'AbstractElements'.
The class 'aml_Drive' is a specialization of 'SuperEntity'.
The class 'aml_Cable' is a specialization of 'SuperEntity'.
The class 'aml_PriceRule' is a specialization of 'AbstractElements'.
The class 'aml_Entity' is a specialization of 'AbstractElements'.
The class 'aml_SuperEntity' is a specialization of 'AbstractElements'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'aml_AbstractElements' and 'aml_Aml'. From 'aml_AbstractElements', the role 'aml_AbstractElements' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'aml_Aml', the role 'aml_Aml' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'aml_MinMax' and 'aml_TargetGroupFeature'. From 'aml_MinMax', the role 'aml_MinMax' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'aml_TargetGroupFeature', the role 'aml_TargetGroupFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
