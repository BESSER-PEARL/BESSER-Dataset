The domain model 'SM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'SM_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SM_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SM_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'SM_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SM_State' and 'SM_StateMachine'. From 'SM_State', the role 'SM_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SM_StateMachine', the role 'SM_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
