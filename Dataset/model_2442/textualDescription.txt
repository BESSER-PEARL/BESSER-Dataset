The domain model 'databaseMetamodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'databaseMetamodel_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'hasPKOrder', which is of type int; 'type', which is of type str; 'hasFKOrder', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'databaseMetamodel_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'databaseMetamodel_Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isSelfJoinTable', which is of type bool; 'isJoinTable', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Database' and 'databaseMetamodel_Relation'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Database', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Database' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Column' and 'databaseMetamodel_Relation'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Column', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Relation' and 'databaseMetamodel_Column'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Column', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Column5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Relation' and 'databaseMetamodel_Column'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Column', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Column8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Relation' and 'databaseMetamodel_Relation'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Column' and 'databaseMetamodel_Column'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Column', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Column12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Column', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Column14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'databaseMetamodel_Relation' and 'databaseMetamodel_Column'. From 'databaseMetamodel_Relation', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Relation17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'databaseMetamodel_Column', the role 'databaseMetamodel_Column16' has cardinality 0..*.
