An association connects 'docbook_DocBook' and 'docbook_Book'. From 'docbook_DocBook', the role 'docbook_DocBook' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_Book', the role 'docbook_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_Article' and 'docbook_Book'. From 'docbook_Article', the role 'docbook_Article' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_Book', the role 'docbook_Book2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_Sect1' and 'docbook_Article'. From 'docbook_Sect1', the role 'docbook_Sect1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_Article', the role 'docbook_Article4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_Para' and 'docbook_Section'. From 'docbook_Para', the role 'docbook_Para' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_Section', the role 'docbook_Section' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_Sect2' and 'docbook_Sect1'. From 'docbook_Sect2', the role 'docbook_Sect2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_Sect1', the role 'docbook_Sect17' has cardinality 0..*.
