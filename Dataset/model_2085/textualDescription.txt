Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PrimitiveTypeEnum' defines the following possible values: 'Integer', 'String', 'Boolean', 'UnlimitedNatural', 'Real'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'cvlmodel_Choice' is a specialization of 'VSpec'.
The class 'cvlmodel_Variable' is a specialization of 'VSpec'.
The class 'cvlmodel_VClassifier' is a specialization of 'VSpec'.
The class 'cvlmodel_ChoiceResolution' is a specialization of 'VSpecResolution'.
The class 'cvlmodel_VariableResolution' is a specialization of 'VSpecResolution'.
The class 'cvlmodel_VClassifierResolution' is a specialization of 'VSpecResolution'.
The class 'cvlmodel_ObjectExistence' is a specialization of 'VariationPoint'.
