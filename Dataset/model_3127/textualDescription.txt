The domain model 'class' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'class_NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'class_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'multiValued', which is of type bool.

'class_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'class_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isAbstract', which is of type bool.

'class_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'class_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'class_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'class_Classifier' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'class_DataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'class_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'class_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'class_Class' and 'class_Package'. From 'class_Class', the role 'class_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'class_Package', the role 'class_Package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'class_Package' and 'class_DataType'. From 'class_Package', the role 'class_Package2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'class_DataType', the role 'class_DataType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'class_Class' and 'class_Class'. From 'class_Class', the role 'class_Class3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'class_Class', the role 'class_Class5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'class_Attribute' and 'class_Class'. From 'class_Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'class_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'class_Attribute' and 'class_Classifier'. From 'class_Attribute', the role 'class_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'class_Classifier', the role 'class_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'class_Attribute' and 'class_Class'. From 'class_Attribute', the role 'attr' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'class_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
