Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'StateType' defines the following possible values: 'TEXTUAL', 'REFERENCE', 'CONDITIONAL', 'NORMAL'.
The enumeration 'TransitionType' defines the following possible values: 'STRONGABORT', 'NORMALTERMINATION', 'WEAKABORT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'synccharts_Emission' is a specialization of 'Effect'.
The class 'synccharts_Region' is a specialization of 'Scope'.
The class 'synccharts_State' is a specialization of 'Scope'.
The class 'synccharts_Transition' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'synccharts_Scope' is a specialization of 'Annotatable'.
The class 'synccharts_TextEffect' is a specialization of 'TextualCode'.
The class 'synccharts_TextEffect' is a specialization of 'Effect'.
