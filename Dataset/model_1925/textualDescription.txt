Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'bibTeX_BibTeXEntry' and 'bibTeX_BibTeXFile'. From 'bibTeX_BibTeXEntry', the role 'bibTeX_BibTeXEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bibTeX_BibTeXFile', the role 'bibTeX_BibTeXFile' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bibTeX_Author' and 'bibTeX_AuthoredEntry'. From 'bibTeX_Author', the role 'bibTeX_Author' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bibTeX_AuthoredEntry', the role 'bibTeX_AuthoredEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
