Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BinaryOp' defines the following possible values: 'AND', 'MUL', 'GEQ', 'LT', 'LEQ', 'EQ', 'ADD', 'GT', 'OR', 'SUB'.
The enumeration 'UnaryOp' defines the following possible values: 'NEGATE', 'NOT'.
