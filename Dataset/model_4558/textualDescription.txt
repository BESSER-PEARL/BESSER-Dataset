The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'platoon_FollowVehicle' is a specialization of 'Vehicle'.
The class 'platoon_LeadingVehicle' is a specialization of 'Vehicle'.
The class 'platoon_ForwardCommand' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'platoon_TurnCommand' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'platoon_HeadwayConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'platoon_LeadingVehicle' and 'platoon_Platoon'. From 'platoon_LeadingVehicle', the role 'platoon_LeadingVehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Platoon' and 'platoon_FollowVehicle'. From 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_FollowVehicle', the role 'platoon_FollowVehicle' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Route' and 'platoon_Command'. From 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Command', the role 'platoon_Command' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Vehicle' and 'platoon_FollowVehicle'. From 'platoon_Vehicle', the role 'platoon_Vehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_FollowVehicle', the role 'platoon_FollowVehicle5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_LeadingVehicle' and 'platoon_Route'. From 'platoon_LeadingVehicle', the role 'platoon_LeadingVehicle7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_World' and 'platoon_Platoon'. From 'platoon_World', the role 'platoon_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon10' has cardinality 0..*.
