The domain model 'wh' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'wh_Definition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'output', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str.

'wh_Commands' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'wh_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'cmd', which is of type str.

'wh_Wh' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'wh_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'wh_Program' and 'wh_Wh'. From 'wh_Program', the role 'wh_Program' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wh_Wh', the role 'wh_Wh' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wh_Definition' and 'wh_Program'. From 'wh_Definition', the role 'wh_Definition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wh_Program', the role 'wh_Program2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wh_Commands' and 'wh_Definition'. From 'wh_Commands', the role 'wh_Commands' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wh_Definition', the role 'wh_Definition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wh_Command' and 'wh_Commands'. From 'wh_Command', the role 'wh_Command' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wh_Commands', the role 'wh_Commands6' has cardinality 0..*.
