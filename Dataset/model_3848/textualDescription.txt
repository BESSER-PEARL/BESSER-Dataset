The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 25 main class(es).

'model_And' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_Equals' is a specialization of 'ComparisonOperator'.
The class 'model_GreaterThan' is a specialization of 'ComparisonOperator'.
The class 'model_LessThan' is a specialization of 'ComparisonOperator'.
The class 'model_NotEquals' is a specialization of 'ComparisonOperator'.
The class 'model_And' is a specialization of 'BooleanOperation'.
The class 'model_Or' is a specialization of 'BooleanOperation'.
The class 'model_Comparison' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'model_Existence' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'model_Exists' is a specialization of 'Existence'.
The class 'model_NotExists' is a specialization of 'Existence'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_Select' and 'model_Column'. From 'model_Select', the role 'model_Select' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Column', the role 'model_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_From' and 'model_Select'. From 'model_From', the role 'model_From' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Select', the role 'model_Select2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Select' and 'model_Where'. From 'model_Select', the role 'model_Select4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Where', the role 'model_Where' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Union' and 'model_Select'. From 'model_Union', the role 'model_Union' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Select', the role 'model_Select6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Column' and 'model_ColumnAlias'. From 'model_Column', the role 'model_Column8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_ColumnAlias', the role 'model_ColumnAlias' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_From' and 'model_Table'. From 'model_From', the role 'model_From10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Table', the role 'model_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
