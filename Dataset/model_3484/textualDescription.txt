Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SelectionState' defines the following possible values: 'unselected', 'selected'.
The enumeration 'VariabilityType' defines the following possible values: 'alternative', 'or', 'mandatory', 'optional'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featureModelMetamodel_VariableFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'featureModelMetamodel_ClonableFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'featureModelMetamodel_AbstractFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'featureModelMetamodel_GroupMultiplicity' is a specialization of 'Multiplicity'.
The class 'featureModelMetamodel_ClonableSelection' is a specialization of 'Selection'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
