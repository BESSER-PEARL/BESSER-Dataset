Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'StyleKind' defines the following possible values: 'Style1', 'Style2'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'abcd_Model' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'abcd_A' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'abcd_B' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'abcd_C' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'abcd_C1' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'abcd_C2' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'abcd_D' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'abcd_D1' is a specialization of 'D'.
The class 'abcd_D2' is a specialization of 'D'.
The class 'abcd_D3' is a specialization of 'D'.
The class 'abcd_D3_B' is a specialization of 'D3'.
The class 'abcd_D3_B' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'abcd_D3_B_C' is a specialization of 'D3_B'.
The class 'abcd_D3_B_C' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'abcd_Other' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'abcd_A' and 'abcd_Model'. From 'abcd_A', the role 'abcd_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_Model', the role 'abcd_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abcd_Other' and 'abcd_Model'. From 'abcd_Other', the role 'abcd_Other' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_Model', the role 'abcd_Model2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abcd_Model' and 'abcd_A'. From 'abcd_Model', the role 'abcd_Model4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_A', the role 'abcd_A5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abcd_B' and 'abcd_Model'. From 'abcd_B', the role 'abcd_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_Model', the role 'abcd_Model7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abcd_C' and 'abcd_Model'. From 'abcd_C', the role 'abcd_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_Model', the role 'abcd_Model9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abcd_Model' and 'abcd_D'. From 'abcd_Model', the role 'abcd_Model11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_D', the role 'abcd_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'abcd_A' and 'abcd_A'. From 'abcd_A', the role 'abcd_A14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'abcd_A', the role 'abcd_A12' has cardinality 0..*.
