The domain model 'metamodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'metamodel_idFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'generationType', which is of type str.

'Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metamodel_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metamodel_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_Relation' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'metamodel_OneToOne' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'metamodel_OneToMany' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'metamodel_ManyToMany' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'metamodel_idFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'metamodel_AssociationEntity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'metamodel_Model' and 'metamodel_Type'. From 'metamodel_Model', the role 'metamodel_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Type', the role 'metamodel_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Model' and 'metamodel_DatabaseConnection'. From 'metamodel_Model', the role 'metamodel_Model2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_DatabaseConnection', the role 'metamodel_DatabaseConnection' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Entity' and 'metamodel_Feature'. From 'metamodel_Entity', the role 'metamodel_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Feature', the role 'metamodel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Relation' and 'metamodel_Entity'. From 'metamodel_Relation', the role 'Relation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Entity', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metamodel_Entity' and 'metamodel_Relation'. From 'metamodel_Entity', the role 'slave' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metamodel_Relation', the role 'Relation6' has cardinality 0..*.
