The domain model 'gemoc' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'gemoc_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'gemoc_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type bool.

'gemoc_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'trigger', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'gemoc_FSM' and 'gemoc_State'. From 'gemoc_FSM', the role 'gemoc_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_State', the role 'gemoc_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gemoc_Transition' and 'gemoc_FSM'. From 'gemoc_Transition', the role 'gemoc_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_FSM', the role 'gemoc_FSM2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gemoc_Transition' and 'gemoc_State'. From 'gemoc_Transition', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_State', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gemoc_Transition' and 'gemoc_State'. From 'gemoc_Transition', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_State', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gemoc_FSM' and 'gemoc_State'. From 'gemoc_FSM', the role 'gemoc_FSM10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_State', the role 'gemoc_State9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gemoc_State' and 'gemoc_Transition'. From 'gemoc_State', the role '13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_Transition', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gemoc_Transition' and 'gemoc_State'. From 'gemoc_Transition', the role '15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gemoc_State', the role '16' has cardinality 0..*.
