The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featureDiagram_PrimitiveFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'featureDiagram_Opt' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'featureDiagram_And' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'featureDiagram_Or' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'featureDiagram_Xor' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'featureDiagram_Card' is a specialization of 'Operator'.
The class 'featureDiagram_Require' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'featureDiagram_Mutex' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'featureDiagram_Feature' and 'featureDiagram_FeatureDiagram'. From 'featureDiagram_Feature', the role 'Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureDiagram_FeatureDiagram', the role 'owningFeatureDiagram' has cardinality 0..*.
