The domain model 'Class' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isAbstract', which is of type str.

'Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Class_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'multiValued', which is of type str.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Class_Classifier' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.
The class 'Class_DataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'Class_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'Class_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElt'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Class' and 'Class_Class'. From 'Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Class', the role 'Class_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Attribute' and 'Class_Class'. From 'Attribute', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Class', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class_Attribute' and 'Classifier'. From 'Class_Attribute', the role 'Class_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class' and 'Class_Attribute'. From 'Class', the role '#5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Attribute', the role '14' has cardinality 0..*.
