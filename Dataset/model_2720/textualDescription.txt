The domain model 'b' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'b_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'b_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'b_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'b_B' and 'b_A'. From 'b_B', the role 'b_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'b_A', the role 'b_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'b_C' and 'b_B'. From 'b_C', the role 'b_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'b_B', the role 'b_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
