The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph_Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'predecessors' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'Node5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'successors' has cardinality 0..*.
