Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AttributeComparisonOperator' defines the following possible values: 'greaterThan', 'lessThan', 'lessThanOrEqual', 'equal', 'unequal', 'greaterThanOrEqual'.
The enumeration 'SelectedState' defines the following possible values: 'deselected', 'undetermined', 'selected'.
