Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Axis' defines the following possible values: 'attribute', 'parent', 'descendant', 'interface', 'child', 'binding', 'sibling', 'ancestororself', 'siblingorself', 'ancestor', 'component', 'descendantorself', 'internalinterface'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'FPath_Expression' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'FPath_ContextExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_VariableExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_FunctionCallExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_NumberExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_StringExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_PathExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_OperatorExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp' is a specialization of 'OperatorExp'.
The class 'FPath_UnaryOperatorExp' is a specialization of 'OperatorExp'.
The class 'FPath_Step' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'FPath_Test' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'FPath_WildcardTest' is a specialization of 'Test'.
The class 'FPath_NameTest' is a specialization of 'Test'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'FPath_FunctionCallExp' and 'FPath_Expression'. From 'FPath_FunctionCallExp', the role 'FPath_FunctionCallExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FPath_Expression', the role 'FPath_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FPath_Expression' and 'FPath_PathExp'. From 'FPath_Expression', the role 'FPath_Expression2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FPath_PathExp', the role 'FPath_PathExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FPath_PathExp' and 'FPath_Step'. From 'FPath_PathExp', the role 'FPath_PathExp4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FPath_Step', the role 'FPath_Step' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FPath_Expression' and 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp'. From 'FPath_Expression', the role 'FPath_Expression6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp', the role 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp' and 'FPath_Expression'. From 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp', the role 'FPath_BinaryOperatorExp8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FPath_Expression', the role 'FPath_Expression9' has cardinality 0..*.
