The domain model 'StateMachineHyperedges' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'StateMachineHyperedges_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachineHyperedges_SimpleState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachineHyperedges_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'StateVertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachineHyperedges_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'StateMachineHyperedges_InitialState' is a specialization of 'StateVertex'.
The class 'StateMachineHyperedges_SimpleState' is a specialization of 'StateVertex'.
The class 'StateMachineHyperedges_FinalState' is a specialization of 'StateVertex'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine' and 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex'. From 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine', the role 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex', the role 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine' and 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition'. From 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine', the role 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition', the role 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition' and 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex'. From 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex', the role 'sources' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex' and 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition'. From 'StateMachineHyperedges_StateVertex', the role 'targets' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachineHyperedges_Event' and 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition'. From 'StateMachineHyperedges_Event', the role 'StateMachineHyperedges_Event' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition', the role 'StateMachineHyperedges_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
