Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FunctionDomain' defines the following possible values: 'form', 'space', 'time'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myffbd_Function' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_And' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_Or' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_Start' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_Final' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_Loop' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_InputPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'myffbd_OutputPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'myffbd_LoopExit' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.
The class 'myffbd_Iteration' is a specialization of 'SequenceNode'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myffbd_Function' and 'myffbd_Function'. From 'myffbd_Function', the role 'myffbd_Function0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myffbd_Function', the role 'myffbd_Function' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myffbd_Function' and 'myffbd_SequenceNode'. From 'myffbd_Function', the role 'myffbd_Function3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myffbd_SequenceNode', the role 'myffbd_SequenceNode' has cardinality 0..*.
