An association connects 'Families_Son' and 'Families_Family'. From 'Families_Son', the role 'Son' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Family', the role 'family4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Family' and 'Families_Daughter'. From 'Families_Family', the role 'family6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Daughter', the role 'Daughter' has cardinality 0..*.
