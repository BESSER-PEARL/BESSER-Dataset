The class 'transport_PipeStyleTransportSystem' is a specialization of 'TransportSystem'.
The class 'transport_TransportSystem' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'transport_PacketTransportLabelValue' is a specialization of 'LabelValue'.
The class 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystemDecorator' is a specialization of 'EdgeDecorator'.
The class 'transport_PipeTransportEdge' is a specialization of 'PopulationEdge'.
The class 'transport_PipeTransportEdgeLabel' is a specialization of 'EdgeLabel'.
The class 'transport_PipeTransportEdgeLabelValue' is a specialization of 'LabelValue'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'transport_STEMTime' and 'transport_LoadUnloadEdgeLabel'. From 'transport_STEMTime', the role 'transport_STEMTime' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'transport_LoadUnloadEdgeLabel', the role 'transport_LoadUnloadEdgeLabel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'transport_STEMTime' and 'transport_LoadUnloadEdgeLabel'. From 'transport_STEMTime', the role 'transport_STEMTime3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'transport_LoadUnloadEdgeLabel', the role 'transport_LoadUnloadEdgeLabel2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem' and 'transport_PacketTransportLabel'. From 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem', the role 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'transport_PacketTransportLabel', the role 'transport_PacketTransportLabel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'transport_LoadUnloadEdge' and 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem'. From 'transport_LoadUnloadEdge', the role 'transport_LoadUnloadEdge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem', the role 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'transport_LoadUnloadEdge' and 'transport_PacketStyleTransportSystem'.
