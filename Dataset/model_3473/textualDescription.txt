The domain model 'myDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'myDsl_ParentChildConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_MandatoryTreeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_FM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_OptionalTreeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_CrossTreeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'myDsl_FeatureAttribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nullValue', which is of type int; 'minValue', which is of type int; 'attributeType', which is of type str; 'maxValue', which is of type int; 'defaultValue', which is of type int.

'myDsl_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDsl_TreeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_OrAlternativeTreeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'min', which is of type int; 'max', which is of type int.

'TreeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl_MandatoryTreeConstraint' is a specialization of 'TreeConstraint'.
The class 'myDsl_OptionalTreeConstraint' is a specialization of 'TreeConstraint'.
The class 'myDsl_OrAlternativeTreeConstraint' is a specialization of 'TreeConstraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_FM' and 'myDsl_Feature'. From 'myDsl_FM', the role 'myDsl_FM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Feature', the role 'myDsl_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_ParentChildConstraint' and 'myDsl_FM'. From 'myDsl_ParentChildConstraint', the role 'myDsl_ParentChildConstraint' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_FM', the role 'myDsl_FM2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_FeatureAttribute' and 'myDsl_FM'. From 'myDsl_FeatureAttribute', the role 'myDsl_FeatureAttribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_FM', the role 'myDsl_FM4' has cardinality 0..*.
