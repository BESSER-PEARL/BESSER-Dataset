The domain model 'metrics' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'metrics_LinkMeasurement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metrics_Measurement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'tag', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'error', which is of type str.

'Measurement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metrics_Observation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metrics_ComplexMeasurement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'metrics_ValueMeasurement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'metrics_ValueMeasurement' is a specialization of 'Measurement'.
The class 'metrics_LinkMeasurement' is a specialization of 'Measurement'.
The class 'metrics_ComplexMeasurement' is a specialization of 'Measurement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ModelElement' and 'metrics_LinkMeasurement'. From 'ModelElement', the role 'ModelElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_LinkMeasurement', the role 'metrics_LinkMeasurement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metrics_ComplexMeasurement' and 'metrics_Measurement'. From 'metrics_ComplexMeasurement', the role 'metrics_ComplexMeasurement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_Measurement', the role 'metrics_Measurement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'metrics_Observation' and 'metrics_Measurement'. From 'metrics_Observation', the role 'metrics_Observation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_Measurement', the role 'metrics_Measurement3' has cardinality 0..*.
