Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Relop' defines the following possible values: 'unequal', 'greaterThan', 'lessThanOrEqual', 'lessThan', 'equal', 'greaterThanOrEqual'.
The enumeration 'FeatureState' defines the following possible values: 'unbound', 'deselected', 'selected'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'feature_Feature' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'feature_Group' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'feature_DiscreteDomain' is a specialization of 'Domain'.
The class 'feature_NumericalDomain' is a specialization of 'Domain'.
The class 'feature_Domain' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'feature_Constraint' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.
The class 'feature_AttributeConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'feature_AttributeReference' is a specialization of 'AttributeOperand'.
The class 'feature_AttributeValue' is a specialization of 'AttributeOperand'.
The class 'feature_FeatureConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'feature_Imply' is a specialization of 'FeatureConstraint'.
The class 'feature_Exclude' is a specialization of 'FeatureConstraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
