The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'actionpak1_ActionstepTest' is a specialization of 'ActionStep'.
The class 'actionpak1_CustomInitiator' is a specialization of 'ParameterizedInitiator'.
The class 'actionpak1_IncomingCall2' is a specialization of 'actionstep_ParameterizedInitiator'.
The class 'actionpak1_IncomingCall2' is a specialization of 'call_CallSource1'.
The class 'actionpak1_InvokeSaflet2' is a specialization of 'ParameterizedActionstep'.
The class 'actionpak1_ScheduleSaflet' is a specialization of 'ParameterizedActionstep'.
The class 'actionpak1_UnscheduleSaflet' is a specialization of 'ActionStep'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'actionpak1_ActionstepTest' and 'DynamicValue'. From 'actionpak1_ActionstepTest', the role 'actionpak1_ActionstepTest' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DynamicValue', the role 'DynamicValue' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actionpak1_InvokeSaflet2' and 'DynamicValue'. From 'actionpak1_InvokeSaflet2', the role 'actionpak1_InvokeSaflet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DynamicValue', the role 'DynamicValue2' has cardinality 0..*.
