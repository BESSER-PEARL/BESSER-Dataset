The domain model 'PetriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'PetriElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Noeud' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Noeud' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_PetriElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'jeton', which is of type int.

'PetriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'poids', which is of type int; 'isReadArc', which is of type bool.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Noeud'.
The class 'PetriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'PetriElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Noeud'.
The class 'PetriNet_Noeud' is a specialization of 'PetriElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_Noeud'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'linksToPredecessors' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Noeud', the role 'Noeud' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Noeud' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_Noeud', the role 'Noeud2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'LinksToSuccessors' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' and 'PetriNet_PetriElement'. From 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri', the role 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' and 'PetriNet_PetriElement'. From 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri', the role 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_Noeud'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Noeud', the role 'successor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Noeud' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_Noeud', the role 'predecessor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc9' has cardinality 0..*.
