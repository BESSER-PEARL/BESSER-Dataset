The domain model 'BD' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'BD_Columna' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nombre', which is of type str; 'tipo', which is of type str.

'BD_Tabla' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nombre', which is of type str.

'BD_EsquemaBD' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TipoPrimitivo' defines the following possible values: 'Integer', 'Boolean', 'String', 'Date', 'Double'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'BD_EsquemaBD' and 'BD_Tabla'. From 'BD_EsquemaBD', the role 'BD_EsquemaBD' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BD_Tabla', the role 'BD_Tabla' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BD_Columna' and 'BD_Tabla'. From 'BD_Columna', the role 'BD_Columna' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BD_Tabla', the role 'BD_Tabla2' has cardinality 0..*.
