An association connects 'tutorial_Library' and 'tutorial_Book'. From 'tutorial_Library', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Book', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Library' and 'tutorial_Loan'. From 'tutorial_Library', the role 'tutorial_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Loan', the role 'tutorial_Loan' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Library' and 'tutorial_Member'. From 'tutorial_Library', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Member', the role '5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Book' and 'tutorial_Library'. From 'tutorial_Book', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Library', the role '8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Loan' and 'tutorial_Book'. From 'tutorial_Loan', the role 'tutorial_Loan10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Book', the role 'tutorial_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Library' and 'tutorial_Member'. From 'tutorial_Library', the role '13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Member', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Member' and 'tutorial_Loan'. From 'tutorial_Member', the role 'tutorial_Member' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Loan', the role 'tutorial_Loan15' has cardinality 0..*.
