The domain model 'formalmetamodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'formalmetamodel_FormalModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'formalmetamodel_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'formalmetamodel_AA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'formalmetamodel_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'formalmetamodel_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'formalmetamodel_A' is a specialization of 'AA'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_A' and 'formalmetamodel_B'. From 'formalmetamodel_A', the role 'formalmetamodel_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_B', the role 'formalmetamodel_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_A' and 'formalmetamodel_B'. From 'formalmetamodel_A', the role 'formalmetamodel_A3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_B', the role 'formalmetamodel_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_B' and 'formalmetamodel_B'. From 'formalmetamodel_B', the role 'formalmetamodel_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_B', the role 'formalmetamodel_B6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_B' and 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel'. From 'formalmetamodel_B', the role 'formalmetamodel_B8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel', the role 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel' and 'formalmetamodel_A'. From 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel', the role 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_A', the role 'formalmetamodel_A11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel' and 'formalmetamodel_C'. From 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel', the role 'formalmetamodel_FormalModel13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_C', the role 'formalmetamodel_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_C' and 'formalmetamodel_C'. From 'formalmetamodel_C', the role 'formalmetamodel_C14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_C', the role 'formalmetamodel_C16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'formalmetamodel_C' and 'formalmetamodel_A'. From 'formalmetamodel_C', the role 'formalmetamodel_C18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'formalmetamodel_A', the role 'formalmetamodel_A19' has cardinality 0..*.
