An association connects 'UML2_StructuralFeatureAction' and 'UML2_StructuralFeature'. From 'UML2_StructuralFeatureAction', the role 'UML2_StructuralFeatureAction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_StructuralFeature', the role 'UML2_StructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_Feature' and 'UML2_Classifier'. From 'UML2_Feature', the role 'UML2_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_Classifier', the role 'UML2_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_WriteStructuralFeatureAction' and 'UML2_InputPin'. From 'UML2_WriteStructuralFeatureAction', the role 'UML2_WriteStructuralFeatureAction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_InputPin', the role 'UML2_InputPin' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_Type' and 'UML2_TypedElement'. From 'UML2_Type', the role 'UML2_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_TypedElement', the role 'UML2_TypedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
