The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'junitresult_Testsuite' is a specialization of 'AbstractAggregatedTest'.
The class 'junitresult_Error' is a specialization of 'NegativeResult'.
The class 'junitresult_Failure' is a specialization of 'NegativeResult'.
The class 'junitresult_Testrun' is a specialization of 'AbstractAggregatedTest'.
The class 'junitresult_AbstractAggregatedTest' is a specialization of 'JunitResult'.
The class 'junitresult_Testsuites' is a specialization of 'AbstractAggregatedTest'.
The class 'junitresult_Skipped' is a specialization of 'NegativeResult'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'junitresult_Property' and 'junitresult_Testsuite'. From 'junitresult_Property', the role 'junitresult_Property' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'junitresult_Testsuite', the role 'junitresult_Testsuite' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'junitresult_Testsuite' and 'junitresult_Testcase'. From 'junitresult_Testsuite', the role 'junitresult_Testsuite2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'junitresult_Testcase', the role 'junitresult_Testcase' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'junitresult_Testcase' and 'junitresult_Skipped'. From 'junitresult_Testcase', the role 'junitresult_Testcase4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'junitresult_Skipped', the role 'junitresult_Skipped' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'junitresult_Testcase' and 'junitresult_Failure'. From 'junitresult_Testcase', the role 'junitresult_Testcase6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'junitresult_Failure', the role 'junitresult_Failure' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'junitresult_Error' and 'junitresult_Testcase'. From 'junitresult_Error', the role 'junitresult_Error' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'junitresult_Testcase', the role 'junitresult_Testcase8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'junitresult_AbstractAggregatedTest' and 'junitresult_Testsuite'. From 'junitresult_AbstractAggregatedTest', the role 'junitresult_AbstractAggregatedTest' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'junitresult_Testsuite', the role 'junitresult_Testsuite10' has cardinality 0..*.
