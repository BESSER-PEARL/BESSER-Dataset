The domain model 'fsmkerm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'fsmkerm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'FSMException' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmkerm_NoInitialStateException' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmkerm_NonDeterminism' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmkerm_FSMException' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmkerm_NoTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmkerm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmkerm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'input', which is of type str; 'output', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsmkerm_NonDeterminism' is a specialization of 'FSMException'.
The class 'fsmkerm_NoTransition' is a specialization of 'FSMException'.
The class 'fsmkerm_NoInitialStateException' is a specialization of 'FSMException'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsmkerm_State' and 'fsmkerm_FSM'. From 'fsmkerm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsmkerm_FSM', the role 'owningFSM' has cardinality 0..*.
