The domain model 'ClassM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'ClassM_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ClassM_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ClassM_StructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'visibility', which is of type str.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ClassM_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ClassM_TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ClassM_PrimitiveType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ClassM_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ClassM_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ClassM_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'multivalued', which is of type bool.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ClassM_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'ClassM_StructuralFeature' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'ClassM_PrimitiveType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'ClassM_Operation' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.
The class 'ClassM_Parameter' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'ClassM_Attribute' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ClassM_Class' and 'ClassM_StructuralFeature'. From 'ClassM_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_StructuralFeature', the role 'StructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Class' and 'ClassM_Class'. From 'ClassM_Class', the role 'ClassM_Class1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_Class', the role 'ClassM_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Class' and 'ClassM_Class'. From 'ClassM_Class', the role 'ClassM_Class3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_Class', the role 'ClassM_Class5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Classifier' and 'ClassM_TypedElement'. From 'ClassM_Classifier', the role 'type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_TypedElement', the role 'TypedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Class' and 'ClassM_StructuralFeature'. From 'ClassM_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_StructuralFeature', the role 'features' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Classifier' and 'ClassM_TypedElement'. From 'ClassM_Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_TypedElement', the role 'typeOf' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Operation' and 'ClassM_Parameter'. From 'ClassM_Operation', the role 'paramOf' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_Parameter', the role 'Parameter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Parameter' and 'ClassM_Operation'. From 'ClassM_Parameter', the role 'params' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_Operation', the role 'Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ClassM_Classifier' and 'ClassM_Model'. From 'ClassM_Classifier', the role 'ClassM_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ClassM_Model', the role 'ClassM_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
