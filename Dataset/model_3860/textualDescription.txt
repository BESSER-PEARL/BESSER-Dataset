The domain model 'table' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'table_Column' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'table_Table' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'table_Column' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'table_Table' and 'table_Column'. From 'table_Table', the role 'table_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'table_Column', the role 'table_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'table_Column' and 'table_Table'. From 'table_Column', the role 'table_Column3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'table_Table', the role 'table_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
