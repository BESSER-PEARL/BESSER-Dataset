The domain model 'testPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'testPackage_Container' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'testPackage_TestElementB' is a specialization of 'TestElementA'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testPackage_Container' and 'testPackage_TestElementA'. From 'testPackage_Container', the role 'testPackage_Container' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testPackage_TestElementA', the role 'testPackage_TestElementA' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testPackage_TestElementA' and 'testPackage_TestElementB'. From 'testPackage_TestElementA', the role 'testPackage_TestElementA2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testPackage_TestElementB', the role 'testPackage_TestElementB' has cardinality 0..*.
