The domain model 'nosql' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'nosql_Row' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nosql_ColumnFamily' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'nosql_Index' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'reference', which is of type str.

'ColumnFamily' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nosql_KeySpace' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'nosql_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'datatype', which is of type str; 'size', which is of type str.

'nosql_Cell' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'nosql_Options' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'nosql_PK' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'counter', 'text', 'float', 'timeuuid', 'ascii', 'double', 'blob', 'int', 'uuid', 'varchar', 'varint', 'boolean', 'bigint', 'decimal', 'timestamp'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'nosql_Row' is a specialization of 'ColumnFamily'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'nosql_Index' and 'nosql_KeySpace'. From 'nosql_Index', the role 'nosql_Index' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nosql_KeySpace', the role 'nosql_KeySpace' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nosql_KeySpace' and 'nosql_ColumnFamily'. From 'nosql_KeySpace', the role 'nosql_KeySpace2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nosql_ColumnFamily', the role 'nosql_ColumnFamily' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nosql_KeySpace' and 'nosql_Options'. From 'nosql_KeySpace', the role 'nosql_KeySpace4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nosql_Options', the role 'nosql_Options' has cardinality 0..*.
