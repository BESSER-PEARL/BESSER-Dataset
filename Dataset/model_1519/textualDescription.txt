The domain model 'sm4' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'sm4_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'sm4_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sm4_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'event', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sm4_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sm4_StateMachine' and 'sm4_State'. From 'sm4_StateMachine', the role 'sm4_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sm4_State', the role 'sm4_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sm4_StateMachine' and 'sm4_State'. From 'sm4_StateMachine', the role 'sm' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sm4_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sm4_Transition' and 'sm4_StateMachine'. From 'sm4_Transition', the role 'sm4_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sm4_StateMachine', the role 'sm4_StateMachine3' has cardinality 0..*.
