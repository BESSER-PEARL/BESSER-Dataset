The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_A' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB' is a specialization of 'EdgeCD'.
The class 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_B' is a specialization of 'D'.
The class 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_BetterEdgeAB' is a specialization of 'EdgeAB'.
The class 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_BetterEdgeKL' is a specialization of 'EdgeKL'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_A'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB', the role 'EdgeAB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_A', the role 'a' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_A'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB', the role 'edgeforA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_A', the role 'A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_B' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB', the role 'edgeforB' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_B' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_B', the role 'b' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeAB', the role 'EdgeAB4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_C' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeCD'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_C', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeCD', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeCD' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeCD' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_D'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeCD', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeCD7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_D', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeKL' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_K'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeKL', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeKL' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_K', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_K' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_L' and 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeKL'. From 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_L', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_L' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeKL', the role 'testmultipleinheritanceedgeclasses_EdgeKL10' has cardinality 0..*.
