'TemporalContainmentProxy' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'drones_MovableObject' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'weight', which is of type float.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ActionKind' defines the following possible values: 'SET', 'SUBTRACT', 'ADD'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'drones_FieldObject' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drones_FieldObject' is a specialization of 'SizedElement'.
The class 'drones_Drone' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drones_Drone' is a specialization of 'SizedElement'.
The class 'drones_Battery' is a specialization of 'TemporalContainmentProxy'.
The class 'drones_ChargeStation' is a specialization of 'ImmovableObject'.
The class 'drones_Mission' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drones_Parameter' is a specialization of 'TemporalContainmentProxy'.
The class 'drones_Action' is a specialization of 'TemporalContainmentProxy'.
The class 'drones_Action' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drones_MovableObject' is a specialization of 'FieldObject'.
The class 'drones_ImmovableObject' is a specialization of 'FieldObject'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'drones_FieldObject' and 'drones_Parameter'. From 'drones_FieldObject', the role 'drones_FieldObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Parameter', the role 'drones_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_Battery' and 'drones_Drone'. From 'drones_Battery', the role 'drones_Battery' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Drone', the role 'drones_Drone' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_ChargeStation' and 'drones_Drone'. From 'drones_ChargeStation', the role 'drones_ChargeStation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Drone', the role 'drones_Drone3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_Action' and 'drones_Drone'. From 'drones_Action', the role 'drones_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Drone', the role 'drones_Drone5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_Mission' and 'drones_FieldObject'. From 'drones_Mission', the role 'drones_Mission' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_FieldObject', the role 'drones_FieldObject7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_Mission' and 'drones_Drone'. From 'drones_Mission', the role 'drones_Mission9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Drone', the role 'drones_Drone10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_TemporalContainmentProxy' and 'drones_Mission'. From 'drones_TemporalContainmentProxy', the role 'drones_TemporalContainmentProxy' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Mission', the role 'drones_Mission12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drones_Action' and 'drones_Mission'. From 'drones_Action', the role 'drones_Action15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drones_Mission', the role 'drones_Mission14' has cardinality 0..*.
