Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ArchimateApplication_Relationship' and 'ArchimateApplication_NodeElement'. From 'ArchimateApplication_Relationship', the role 'ArchimateApplication_Relationship' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ArchimateApplication_NodeElement', the role 'ArchimateApplication_NodeElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ArchimateApplication_NodeElement' and 'ArchimateApplication_Relationship'. From 'ArchimateApplication_NodeElement', the role 'ArchimateApplication_NodeElement3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ArchimateApplication_Relationship', the role 'ArchimateApplication_Relationship2' has cardinality 0..*.
