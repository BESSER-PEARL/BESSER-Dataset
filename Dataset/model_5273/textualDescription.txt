The domain model 'input' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 1 main class(es).

'input_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'input_A' and 'input_A'. From 'input_A', the role 'input_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'input_A', the role 'input_A0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'input_A' and 'input_A'. From 'input_A', the role 'input_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'input_A', the role 'input_A4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'input_A' and 'input_A'. From 'input_A', the role 'input_A7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'input_A', the role 'input_A5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'input_A' and 'input_A'. From 'input_A', the role 'input_A10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'input_A', the role 'input_A8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'input_A' and 'input_A'. From 'input_A', the role 'input_A13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'input_A', the role 'input_A11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'input_A' and 'input_A'. From 'input_A', the role 'input_A14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'input_A', the role 'input_A16' has cardinality 0..*.
