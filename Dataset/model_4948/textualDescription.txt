The domain model 'micro' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 20 main class(es).

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'CRUDOperation' defines the following possible values: 'create', 'retrieve', 'delete', 'update'.
The enumeration 'AttributePrimitiveValue' defines the following possible values: 'long', 'String', 'short', 'int', 'char', 'float', 'boolean'.
The enumeration 'CommandType' defines the following possible values: 'compensate', 'reply', 'invoke'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
