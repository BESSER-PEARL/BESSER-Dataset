Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'document_Section' and 'document_Chapter'. From 'document_Section', the role 'document_Section' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'document_Chapter', the role 'document_Chapter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'document_Table' and 'document_Section'. From 'document_Table', the role 'document_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'document_Section', the role 'document_Section2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'document_Entry' and 'document_Table'. From 'document_Entry', the role 'document_Entry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'document_Table', the role 'document_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
