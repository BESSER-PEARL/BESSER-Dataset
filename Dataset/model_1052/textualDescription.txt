The domain model 'devs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'devs_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'devs_OutputFunction' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'devs_ExternalTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'devs_InternalTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'devs_InputEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'devs_AtomicModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'devs_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'lifeTime', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str.

'Event' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'devs_OutputEvent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'devs_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'devs_InputEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'devs_OutputEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'devs_InternalTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'devs_ExternalTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
