The domain model 'a' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'a_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'a_PackageDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'a_Greeting' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'a_Model' and 'a_PackageDeclaration'. From 'a_Model', the role 'a_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_PackageDeclaration', the role 'a_PackageDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_PackageDeclaration' and 'a_Greeting'. From 'a_PackageDeclaration', the role 'a_PackageDeclaration2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_Greeting', the role 'a_Greeting' has cardinality 0..*.
