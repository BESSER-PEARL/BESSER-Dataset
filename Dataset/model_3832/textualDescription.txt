The model defines 1 main class(es).

'attributeTest_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'longPrimitive', which is of type str; 'listInt1', which is of type int; 'byteObj', which is of type str; 'bigInteger', which is of type str; 'javaObject', which is of type str; 'stringObj', which is of type str; 'listString', which is of type str; 'doubleObj', which is of type str; 'charPrimitive', which is of type str; 'shortObj', which is of type str; 'listShort', which is of type str; 'map', which is of type str; 'floatPrimitive', which is of type float; 'intObj', which is of type str; 'listInt', which is of type int; 'longObj', which is of type str; 'date', which is of type date; 'boolPrimitive', which is of type bool; 'boolObj', which is of type str; 'shortPrimitive', which is of type str; 'intPrimitive', which is of type int; 'eList', which is of type str; 'floatObj', which is of type str; 'bytePrimitive', which is of type str; 'bigDecimal', which is of type str; 'listInt2', which is of type int; 'byteArray', which is of type str; 'charObj', which is of type str; 'doublePrimitive', which is of type float.
