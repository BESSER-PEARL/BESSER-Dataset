The domain model 'PrimitiveTypes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'Families_Family' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'lastName', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Member' and 'Families_Family'. From 'Member', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Family', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Member' and 'Families_Family'. From 'Member', the role '#3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Family', the role '02' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Family' and 'Member'. From 'Families_Family', the role '05' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Member', the role '#6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Member' and 'Families_Family'. From 'Member', the role '#9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Family', the role '08' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Member' and 'Family'. From 'Families_Member', the role '011' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Family', the role '#12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Member' and 'Family'. From 'Families_Member', the role '014' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Family', the role '#15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Member' and 'Family'. From 'Families_Member', the role '017' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Family', the role '#18' has cardinality 0..*.
