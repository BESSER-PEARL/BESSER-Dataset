The domain model 'SimpleUML' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'SimpleUML_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_PrimitiveDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PackageElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'UMLModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_UMLModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'kind', which is of type str.

'SimpleUML_PackageElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SimpleUML_Classifier' is a specialization of 'PackageElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_Attribute' is a specialization of 'UMLModelElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'SimpleUML_Association' is a specialization of 'PackageElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_PrimitiveDataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'SimpleUML_Package' is a specialization of 'UMLModelElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_PackageElement' is a specialization of 'UMLModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_Classifier' and 'SimpleUML_Attribute'. From 'SimpleUML_Classifier', the role 'SimpleUML_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_Attribute', the role 'SimpleUML_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_Attribute' and 'SimpleUML_Class'. From 'SimpleUML_Attribute', the role 'attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
