Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Orientation' defines the following possible values: 'anti', 'normal'.
The enumeration 'Temp' defines the following possible values: 'without', 'cold', 'hot'.
The enumeration 'Quantor' defines the following possible values: 'existencial', 'universal'.
