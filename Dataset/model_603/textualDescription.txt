The domain model 'mvc' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 18 main class(es).

'mvc_UIComponent' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

It has the following attributes: 'version', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'mvc_UIActions' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mvc_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'mvc_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AssociationType' is defined but does not specify any literals.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
