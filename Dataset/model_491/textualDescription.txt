The domain model 'PrimitiveTypes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'Member' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Families_MemberMale' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'test', which is of type str.

'Families_Member' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'firstName', which is of type str.

'Family' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Families_Family' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'lastName', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Families_MemberMale' is a specialization of 'Member'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Member' and 'Families_Family'. From 'Member', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Family', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Member' and 'Families_Family'. From 'Member', the role '#3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Family', the role '02' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Family' and 'Member'. From 'Families_Family', the role '05' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Member', the role '#6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Family' and 'Member'. From 'Families_Family', the role '08' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Member', the role '#9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Family' and 'Families_Member'. From 'Family', the role '#12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Member', the role '011' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Family' and 'Families_Member'. From 'Family', the role '#15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Families_Member', the role '014' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Member' and 'Family'. From 'Families_Member', the role '017' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Family', the role '#18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Families_Member' and 'Family'. From 'Families_Member', the role '020' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Family', the role '#21' has cardinality 0..*.
