The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'actions_Action' is a specialization of 'Process'.
The class 'actions_AtomicAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'actions_AtomicAction' is a specialization of 'AtomicProcess'.
The class 'actions_CompositeAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'actions_CompositeAction' is a specialization of 'CompositeProcess'.
The class 'actions_AtomicActionResult' is a specialization of 'ActionResult'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'actions_Action' and 'actions_Role'. From 'actions_Action', the role 'actions_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_Role', the role 'actions_Role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actions_AtomicAction' and 'actions_AtomicActionResult'. From 'actions_AtomicAction', the role 'actions_AtomicAction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_AtomicActionResult', the role 'actions_AtomicActionResult' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actions_ActionResult' and 'actions_Condition'. From 'actions_ActionResult', the role 'actions_ActionResult' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_Condition', the role 'actions_Condition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actions_ActionResult' and 'actions_Expression'. From 'actions_ActionResult', the role 'actions_ActionResult4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_Expression', the role 'actions_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actions_ActionResult' and 'actions_Expression'. From 'actions_ActionResult', the role 'actions_ActionResult6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_Expression', the role 'actions_Expression7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actions_Distribution' and 'actions_AtomicActionResult'. From 'actions_Distribution', the role 'actions_Distribution' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_AtomicActionResult', the role 'actions_AtomicActionResult9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'actions_AtomicActionResult' and 'actions_Distribution'. From 'actions_AtomicActionResult', the role 'actions_AtomicActionResult11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'actions_Distribution', the role 'actions_Distribution12' has cardinality 0..*.
