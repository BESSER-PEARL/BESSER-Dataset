The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'model_ExtraBall' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isValidBall', which is of type str; 'extraType', which is of type str.

'model_Innings' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'wicketsDown', which is of type int; 'Summary', which is of type str; 'total', which is of type int; 'noOvers', which is of type int; 'overCount', which is of type str.

'model_Ball' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'runValue', which is of type int; 'runs', which is of type str; 'switchEnds', which is of type str.

'model_Player' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'howOut', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'runsScored', which is of type int; 'noBallsFaced', which is of type int; 'noOversBowled', which is of type str.

'model_Game' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'venue', which is of type str; 'date', which is of type date.

'model_Team' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'model_WicketBall' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'howOut', which is of type str.

'Ball' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Over' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'validBalls', which is of type int; 'isComplete', which is of type bool; 'runs', which is of type int; 'BALLS_IN_OVER', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'HowOut' defines the following possible values: 'Bowled', 'Run_Out', 'Lbw', 'Caught', 'Stumped'.
The enumeration 'ExtraType' defines the following possible values: 'LegBye', 'Bye', 'NoBall', 'Wide'.
The enumeration 'BallType' defines the following possible values: 'one_run', 'four_runs', 'three_runs', 'six_runs', 'dot_ball', 'two_runs'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_WicketBall' is a specialization of 'Ball'.
The class 'model_ExtraBall' is a specialization of 'Ball'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
