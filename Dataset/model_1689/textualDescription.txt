The class 'helloworld150_Person' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'helloworld150_World' and 'helloworld150_Thing'. From 'helloworld150_World', the role 'helloworld150_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld150_Thing', the role 'helloworld150_Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld150_Person' and 'helloworld150_World'. From 'helloworld150_Person', the role 'helloworld150_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld150_World', the role 'helloworld150_World2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld150_Profession' and 'helloworld150_World'. From 'helloworld150_Profession', the role 'helloworld150_Profession' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld150_World', the role 'helloworld150_World4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'helloworld150_Thing' and 'helloworld150_Own'. From 'helloworld150_Thing', the role 'thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'helloworld150_Own', the role 'Own' has cardinality 0..*.
