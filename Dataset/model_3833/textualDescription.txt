The domain model 'realop' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'realop_XorExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_NotExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_Realop' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_AndExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_IsNegative' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'featureName', which is of type str.

'realop_OrExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_IsPositive' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'featureName', which is of type str.

'realop_IsRealised' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'featureName', which is of type str.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'realop_Operator' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'realop_OrExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'realop_AndExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'realop_XorExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'realop_NotExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'realop_IsRealised' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'realop_IsPositive' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'realop_IsNegative' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'realop_Realop' and 'realop_Operator'. From 'realop_Realop', the role 'realop_Realop' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'realop_Operator', the role 'realop_Operator' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'realop_Operator' and 'realop_Expression'. From 'realop_Operator', the role 'realop_Operator2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'realop_Expression', the role 'realop_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
