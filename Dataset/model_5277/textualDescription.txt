The domain model 'a' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'a_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'a_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'a_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'a_EObject' and 'a_A'. From 'a_EObject', the role 'a_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_A', the role 'a_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_A' and 'a_B'. From 'a_A', the role 'a_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_B', the role 'a_B' has cardinality 0..*.
