The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'model_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'trigger', which is of type str.

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_FiniteStateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type bool.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'model_FiniteStateMachine' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_AbstractState' and 'model_FiniteStateMachine'. From 'model_AbstractState', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_FiniteStateMachine', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_AbstractState' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_AbstractState', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_FiniteStateMachine' and 'model_AbstractState'. From 'model_FiniteStateMachine', the role 'model_FiniteStateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_AbstractState', the role 'model_AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_FiniteStateMachine' and 'model_AbstractState'. From 'model_FiniteStateMachine', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_AbstractState', the role '8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_FiniteStateMachine' and 'model_AbstractState'. From 'model_FiniteStateMachine', the role 'model_FiniteStateMachine10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_AbstractState', the role 'model_AbstractState11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_AbstractState' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_AbstractState', the role '14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role '13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Transition' and 'model_AbstractState'. From 'model_Transition', the role 'model_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_AbstractState', the role 'model_AbstractState16' has cardinality 0..*.
