Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Turtle' and 'vmlogo_Point'. From 'vmlogo_Turtle', the role 'vmlogo_Turtle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Point', the role 'vmlogo_Point' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Segment' and 'vmlogo_Turtle'. From 'vmlogo_Segment', the role 'vmlogo_Segment' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Turtle', the role 'vmlogo_Turtle2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_CallStack' and 'vmlogo_Turtle'. From 'vmlogo_CallStack', the role 'vmlogo_CallStack' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Turtle', the role 'vmlogo_Turtle4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Segment' and 'vmlogo_Point'. From 'vmlogo_Segment', the role 'vmlogo_Segment6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Point', the role 'vmlogo_Point7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Point' and 'vmlogo_Segment'. From 'vmlogo_Point', the role 'vmlogo_Point10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_Segment', the role 'vmlogo_Segment9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_StackFrame' and 'vmlogo_CallStack'. From 'vmlogo_StackFrame', the role 'vmlogo_StackFrame' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_CallStack', the role 'vmlogo_CallStack12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'vmlogo_Variable' and 'vmlogo_StackFrame'. From 'vmlogo_Variable', the role 'vmlogo_Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'vmlogo_StackFrame', the role 'vmlogo_StackFrame14' has cardinality 0..*.
