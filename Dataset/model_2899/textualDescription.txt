The domain model 'forms' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'forms_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'forms_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'abstract', which is of type bool.

'forms_EntityModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FeatureKind' defines the following possible values: 'containment', 'attribute', 'reference'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'forms_Type' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'forms_DataType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'forms_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'forms_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'forms_Feature' and 'forms_Entity'. From 'forms_Feature', the role 'forms_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Entity', the role 'forms_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_Type' and 'forms_EntityModel'. From 'forms_Type', the role 'forms_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_EntityModel', the role 'forms_EntityModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_Type' and 'forms_Feature'. From 'forms_Type', the role 'forms_Type4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Feature', the role 'forms_Feature3' has cardinality 0..*.
