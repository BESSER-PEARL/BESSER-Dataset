The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'employee_SmallProject' is a specialization of 'Project'.
The class 'employee_LargeProject' is a specialization of 'Project'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'employee_Employee' and 'employee_Project'. From 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Project', the role 'employee_Project' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_Employee' and 'employee_PhoneNumber'. From 'employee_Employee', the role 'Employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_PhoneNumber', the role 'phoneNumbers' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_EmploymentPeriod' and 'employee_Employee'. From 'employee_EmploymentPeriod', the role 'employee_EmploymentPeriod' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_Address' and 'employee_Employee'. From 'employee_Address', the role 'employee_Address' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'employee_Employee' and 'employee_JobTitle'. From 'employee_Employee', the role 'employee_Employee7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'employee_JobTitle', the role 'employee_JobTitle' has cardinality 0..*.
