The model defines 2 main class(es).

'ecore_EClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ecore_EPackage' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ecore_EClass' and 'ecore_EPackage'. From 'ecore_EClass', the role 'myClasses' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ecore_EPackage', the role 'EPackage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ecore_EClass' and 'ecore_EPackage'. From 'ecore_EClass', the role 'EClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ecore_EPackage', the role 'conflictingOpposite' has cardinality 0..*.
