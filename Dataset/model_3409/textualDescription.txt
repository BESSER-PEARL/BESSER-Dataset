The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'test_Address' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'city', which is of type str; 'street', which is of type str.

'test_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'lastname', which is of type str; 'firstname', which is of type str.

'test_Contact' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ContactType' defines the following possible values: 'PHONE', 'EMAIL'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_Person' and 'test_Address'. From 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Address', the role 'test_Address' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_Person' and 'test_Contact'. From 'test_Person', the role 'test_Person2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Contact', the role 'test_Contact' has cardinality 0..*.
