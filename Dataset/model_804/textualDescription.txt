The domain model 'kfsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'kfsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'output', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str.

'kfsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'kfsm_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'kfsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'kfsm_State' and 'kfsm_FSM'. From 'kfsm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kfsm_FSM', the role 'owningFSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kfsm_FSM' and 'kfsm_State'. From 'kfsm_FSM', the role 'kfsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kfsm_State', the role 'kfsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kfsm_State' and 'kfsm_FSM'. From 'kfsm_State', the role 'kfsm_State4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kfsm_FSM', the role 'kfsm_FSM3' has cardinality 0..*.
