The domain model 'SimpleUml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUml_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'primitiveType', which is of type str; 'isContainment', which is of type bool.

'SimpleUml_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUml_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUml_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SimpleUml_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'SimpleUml_Property' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'SimpleUml_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimpleUml_Property' and 'SimpleUml_Class'. From 'SimpleUml_Property', the role 'SimpleUml_Property' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUml_Class', the role 'SimpleUml_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUml_Class' and 'SimpleUml_Class'. From 'SimpleUml_Class', the role 'SimpleUml_Class3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUml_Class', the role 'SimpleUml_Class1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUml_Class' and 'SimpleUml_Property'. From 'SimpleUml_Class', the role 'SimpleUml_Class6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUml_Property', the role 'SimpleUml_Property5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUml_Class' and 'SimpleUml_Package'. From 'SimpleUml_Class', the role 'SimpleUml_Class8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUml_Package', the role 'SimpleUml_Package' has cardinality 0..*.
