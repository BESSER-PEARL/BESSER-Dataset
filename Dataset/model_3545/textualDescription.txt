The domain model 'functioncall' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'functioncall_ConceptA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'functioncall_ConceptB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ConceptA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'functioncall_ConceptC' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'functioncall_ConceptB' is a specialization of 'ConceptA'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'functioncall_ConceptC' and 'functioncall_ConceptA'. From 'functioncall_ConceptC', the role 'functioncall_ConceptC' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'functioncall_ConceptA', the role 'functioncall_ConceptA' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'functioncall_ConceptA' and 'functioncall_ConceptC'. From 'functioncall_ConceptA', the role 'functioncall_ConceptA3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'functioncall_ConceptC', the role 'functioncall_ConceptC2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'functioncall_ConceptC' and 'functioncall_ConceptB'. From 'functioncall_ConceptC', the role 'functioncall_ConceptC5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'functioncall_ConceptB', the role 'functioncall_ConceptB' has cardinality 0..*.
