The domain model 'QualityMetrics' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'QualityMetrics_AggregatedRealMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Minimum', which is of type float; 'Average', which is of type float; 'Maximum', which is of type float; 'Median', which is of type float; 'StandardDeviation', which is of type float.

'QualityMetrics_Metrics' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'TrafoName', which is of type str.

'QualityMetrics_SimpleMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Value', which is of type int.

'QualityMetrics_Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Metric', which is of type str.

'QualityMetrics_AggregatedIntegerMetric' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Minimum', which is of type int; 'Average', which is of type float; 'Maximum', which is of type int; 'Median', which is of type int; 'StandardDeviation', which is of type float.

'Metric' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'QualityMetrics_SimpleMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.
The class 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedIntegerMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.
The class 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedRealMetric' is a specialization of 'Metric'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'QualityMetrics_SimpleMetric' and 'QualityMetrics_Metrics'. From 'QualityMetrics_SimpleMetric', the role 'QualityMetrics_SimpleMetric' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'QualityMetrics_Metrics', the role 'QualityMetrics_Metrics' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'QualityMetrics_Metrics' and 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedIntegerMetric'. From 'QualityMetrics_Metrics', the role 'QualityMetrics_Metrics2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedIntegerMetric', the role 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedIntegerMetric' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'QualityMetrics_Metrics' and 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedRealMetric'. From 'QualityMetrics_Metrics', the role 'QualityMetrics_Metrics4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedRealMetric', the role 'QualityMetrics_AggregatedRealMetric' has cardinality 0..*.
