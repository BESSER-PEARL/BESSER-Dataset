The domain model 'TestPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'TestPackage_SubPackage_SubTestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'testStringAttr', which is of type str; 'testBooleanAttr', which is of type bool; 'testAttr', which is of type date; 'testRealAttr', which is of type str; 'testIntAttr', which is of type int.

'UberClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_UberClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_TestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'testAttr', which is of type date; 'testAttr7', which is of type int; 'testAttr4', which is of type int; 'testAttr1', which is of type int; 'testAttr3', which is of type int; 'testStringAttr', which is of type str; 'testIntAttr', which is of type int; 'testRealAttr', which is of type str; 'testAttr2', which is of type int; 'testUnlimitedNaturalAttr', which is of type str; 'testAttr8', which is of type int; 'testBooleanAttr', which is of type bool; 'testAttr5', which is of type int; 'testAttr6', which is of type int.

'TestPackage_TestInterface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SuperClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_SuperClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_SubPackage_SubTestInterface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SubTestEnum' is defined but does not specify any literals.
The enumeration 'TestEnum' is defined but does not specify any literals.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'TestPackage_TestClass' is a specialization of 'SuperClass'.
The class 'TestPackage_TestClass' is a specialization of 'UberClass'.
The class 'TestPackage_TestInterface' is a specialization of 'SuperClass'.
