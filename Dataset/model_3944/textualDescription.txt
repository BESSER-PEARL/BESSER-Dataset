The domain model 'PrimitiveTypes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'PathExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PathExp_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PathExp_PathExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PathExp_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PathExp_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PathExp_PathExp' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PathExp_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'State' and 'PathExp_PathExp'. From 'State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PathExp_PathExp', the role 'PathExp_PathExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PathExp_PathExp' and 'Transition'. From 'PathExp_PathExp', the role 'PathExp_PathExp2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Transition' and 'PathExp_State'. From 'Transition', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PathExp_State', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PathExp_State' and 'Transition'. From 'PathExp_State', the role '05' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Transition', the role '#6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PathExp' and 'PathExp_State'. From 'PathExp', the role 'PathExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PathExp_State', the role 'PathExp_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'State' and 'PathExp_Transition'. From 'State', the role '#10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PathExp_Transition', the role '09' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'State' and 'PathExp_Transition'. From 'State', the role '#13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PathExp_Transition', the role '012' has cardinality 0..*.
