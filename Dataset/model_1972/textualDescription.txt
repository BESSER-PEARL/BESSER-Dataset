The domain model 'traces' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'traces_TraceSet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traces_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'traces_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'rule', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'traces_Trace' and 'traces_TraceSet'. From 'traces_Trace', the role 'traces_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traces_TraceSet', the role 'traces_TraceSet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'traces_EObject' and 'traces_Trace'. From 'traces_EObject', the role 'traces_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traces_Trace', the role 'traces_Trace2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'traces_EObject' and 'traces_Trace'. From 'traces_EObject', the role 'traces_EObject5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'traces_Trace', the role 'traces_Trace4' has cardinality 0..*.
