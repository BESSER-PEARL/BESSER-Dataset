'fsa_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'accepting', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'fsa_FSA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsa_FSA' and 'fsa_State'. From 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_Transition' and 'fsa_FSA'. From 'fsa_Transition', the role 'fsa_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsa_State' and 'fsa_FSA'. From 'fsa_State', the role 'fsa_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsa_FSA', the role 'fsa_FSA4' has cardinality 0..*.
