The domain model 'facademapping' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'facademapping_StereotypedMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'facademapping_Mapping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Mapping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'facademapping_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'facademapping_FacadeMappping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ExtensionDefinitionKind' defines the following possible values: 'Generalization', 'MultiGeneralization', 'Association', 'Fusion'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'facademapping_StereotypedMapping' is a specialization of 'Mapping'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'facademapping_EObject' and 'facademapping_Mapping'. From 'facademapping_EObject', the role 'facademapping_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'facademapping_Mapping', the role 'facademapping_Mapping' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'facademapping_Mapping' and 'facademapping_EObject'. From 'facademapping_Mapping', the role 'facademapping_Mapping2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'facademapping_EObject', the role 'facademapping_EObject3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'facademapping_StereotypedMapping' and 'facademapping_EObject'. From 'facademapping_StereotypedMapping', the role 'facademapping_StereotypedMapping' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'facademapping_EObject', the role 'facademapping_EObject5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'facademapping_Mapping' and 'facademapping_FacadeMappping'. From 'facademapping_Mapping', the role 'facademapping_Mapping7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'facademapping_FacadeMappping', the role 'facademapping_FacadeMappping' has cardinality 0..*.
