The domain model 'FiniteStateMachines' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'FiniteStateMachines_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'isEndState', which is of type bool; 'isStartState', which is of type bool.

'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'FiniteStateMachines_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'input', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'FiniteStateMachines_State' and 'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine'. From 'FiniteStateMachines_State', the role 'FiniteStateMachines_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine', the role 'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine' and 'FiniteStateMachines_Transition'. From 'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine', the role 'FiniteStateMachines_FiniteStateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FiniteStateMachines_Transition', the role 'FiniteStateMachines_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
