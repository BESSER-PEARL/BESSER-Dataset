The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_Fsm' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_Fsm' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Fsm', the role 'fsm_Fsm' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Fsm'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Fsm', the role 'fsm_Fsm2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
