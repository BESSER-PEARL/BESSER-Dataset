The domain model 'logo' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'logo_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'logo_Left' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'angle', which is of type int.

'logo_LogoProgram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Instruction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'logo_ProcCall' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'actualArgs', which is of type int.

'logo_Right' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'angle', which is of type int.

'logo_Forward' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'steps', which is of type int.

'logo_ProcDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'logo_Instruction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'logo_ProcDeclaration' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'logo_ProcCall' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'logo_Forward' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'logo_Left' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.
The class 'logo_Right' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'logo_LogoProgram' and 'logo_Instruction'. From 'logo_LogoProgram', the role 'logo_LogoProgram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'logo_Instruction', the role 'logo_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'logo_ProcDeclaration' and 'logo_Parameter'. From 'logo_ProcDeclaration', the role 'logo_ProcDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'logo_Parameter', the role 'logo_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'logo_ProcDeclaration' and 'logo_Instruction'. From 'logo_ProcDeclaration', the role 'logo_ProcDeclaration3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'logo_Instruction', the role 'logo_Instruction4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'logo_ProcCall' and 'logo_ProcDeclaration'. From 'logo_ProcCall', the role 'logo_ProcCall' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'logo_ProcDeclaration', the role 'logo_ProcDeclaration6' has cardinality 0..*.
