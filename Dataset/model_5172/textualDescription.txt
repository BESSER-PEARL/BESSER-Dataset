The domain model 'ABC' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'ABC_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'a', which is of type str.

'ABC_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'b', which is of type str.

'ABC_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'c', which is of type str.

'ABC_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ABC_A' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'ABC_B' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'ABC_C' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ABC_Root' and 'ABC_Element'. From 'ABC_Root', the role 'ABC_Root' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ABC_Element', the role 'ABC_Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ABC_Element' and 'ABC_Element'. From 'ABC_Element', the role 'ABC_Element3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ABC_Element', the role 'ABC_Element1' has cardinality 0..*.
