The model defines 2 main class(es).

'feature_Model' represents an important domain concept.

'feature_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'attribute', which is of type str; 'min', which is of type int; 'isSelected', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str; 'max', which is of type int.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'feature_Feature' and 'feature_Feature'. From 'feature_Feature', the role 'feature_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'feature_Feature', the role 'feature_Feature0' has cardinality 0..*.
