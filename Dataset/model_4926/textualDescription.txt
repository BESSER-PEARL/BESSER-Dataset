The class 'bootstrap_Spinner' is a specialization of 'FormWidget'.
The class 'bootstrap_CheckBox' is a specialization of 'FormWidget'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Site' and 'bootstrap_Page'. From 'bootstrap_Site', the role 'site' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_Page', the role 'Page' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Site' and 'bootstrap_MainPage'. From 'bootstrap_Site', the role 'site2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_MainPage', the role 'MainPage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Section' and 'bootstrap_Page'. From 'bootstrap_Section', the role 'Section' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_Page', the role 'page' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Site' and 'bootstrap_Page'. From 'bootstrap_Site', the role 'Site' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_Page', the role 'pages' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Site' and 'bootstrap_MainPage'. From 'bootstrap_Site', the role 'Site6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_MainPage', the role 'mainPage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Widget' and 'bootstrap_Section'. From 'bootstrap_Widget', the role 'Widget' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_Section', the role 'section' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bootstrap_Section' and 'bootstrap_Page'. From 'bootstrap_Section', the role 'sections' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bootstrap_Page', the role 'Page9' has cardinality 0..*.
