An association connects 'library_Writer' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Writer', the role 'library_Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Member' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Member', the role 'library_Member' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Writer' and 'library_Book'. From 'library_Writer', the role 'Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Book', the role 'books' has cardinality 0..*.
