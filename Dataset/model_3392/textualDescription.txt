The class 'mindmap_MainTopic' is a specialization of 'Topic'.
The class 'mindmap_SubTopic' is a specialization of 'Topic'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mindmap_MindMap' and 'mindmap_CentralTopic'. From 'mindmap_MindMap', the role 'mindmap_MindMap' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindmap_CentralTopic', the role 'mindmap_CentralTopic' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindmap_MainTopic' and 'mindmap_CentralTopic'. From 'mindmap_MainTopic', the role 'mindmap_MainTopic' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindmap_CentralTopic', the role 'mindmap_CentralTopic2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindmap_SubTopic' and 'mindmap_MainTopic'. From 'mindmap_SubTopic', the role 'mindmap_SubTopic' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindmap_MainTopic', the role 'mindmap_MainTopic4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindmap_SubTopic' and 'mindmap_SubTopic'. From 'mindmap_SubTopic', the role 'mindmap_SubTopic5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindmap_SubTopic', the role 'mindmap_SubTopic7' has cardinality 0..*.
