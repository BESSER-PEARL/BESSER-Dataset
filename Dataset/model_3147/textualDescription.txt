Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'oclstdlibcs_JavaImplementationCS' and 'oclstdlibcs_JavaClassCS'. From 'oclstdlibcs_JavaImplementationCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_JavaImplementationCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstdlibcs_JavaClassCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_JavaClassCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstdlibcs_MetaclassNameCS' and 'oclstdlibcs_LibClassCS'. From 'oclstdlibcs_MetaclassNameCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_MetaclassNameCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstdlibcs_LibClassCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_LibClassCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstdlibcs_ParameterCS' and 'oclstdlibcs_LibIterationCS'. From 'oclstdlibcs_ParameterCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_ParameterCS' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstdlibcs_LibIterationCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_LibIterationCS' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstdlibcs_ParameterCS' and 'oclstdlibcs_LibIterationCS'. From 'oclstdlibcs_ParameterCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_ParameterCS5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstdlibcs_LibIterationCS', the role 'oclstdlibcs_LibIterationCS4' has cardinality 0..*.
