The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'platoon_Forward' is a specialization of 'routeCommand'.
The class 'platoon_TurnLeft' is a specialization of 'routeCommand'.
The class 'platoon_TurnRight' is a specialization of 'routeCommand'.
The class 'platoon_FollowingVehicle' is a specialization of 'Vehicle'.
The class 'platoon_LeaderVehicle' is a specialization of 'Vehicle'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'platoon_Platoon' and 'platoon_Root'. From 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Root', the role 'platoon_Root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Route' and 'platoon_Root'. From 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Root', the role 'platoon_Root2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Root' and 'platoon_Constraints'. From 'platoon_Root', the role 'platoon_Root4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Constraints', the role 'platoon_Constraints' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_routeCommand' and 'platoon_Route'. From 'platoon_routeCommand', the role 'platoon_routeCommand' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_LeaderVehicle' and 'platoon_Platoon'. From 'platoon_LeaderVehicle', the role 'platoon_LeaderVehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_FollowingVehicle' and 'platoon_Platoon'. From 'platoon_FollowingVehicle', the role 'platoon_FollowingVehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Vehicle' and 'platoon_FollowingVehicle'. From 'platoon_Vehicle', the role 'platoon_Vehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_FollowingVehicle', the role 'platoon_FollowingVehicle12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_LeaderVehicle' and 'platoon_Route'. From 'platoon_LeaderVehicle', the role 'platoon_LeaderVehicle14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route15' has cardinality 0..*.
