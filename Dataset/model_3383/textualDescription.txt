The domain model 'errors' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'errors_ColumnFk' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameColumn', which is of type str.

'errors_Error' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_Errores' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameTable', which is of type str.

'Error' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errors_ColumnCk' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'columnName', which is of type str.

'errors_CheckError' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nameCk', which is of type str; 'nameTable', which is of type str; 'porcent', which is of type str.

'errors_ForeignError' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'porcent', which is of type str; 'nameFk', which is of type str.

'errors_ValueCk' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'errors_ForeignError' is a specialization of 'Error'.
The class 'errors_CheckError' is a specialization of 'Error'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'errors_Errores' and 'errors_Error'. From 'errors_Errores', the role 'errors_Errores' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Error', the role 'errors_Error' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ForeignError' and 'errors_Table'. From 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Table', the role 'errors_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ForeignError' and 'errors_Table'. From 'errors_ForeignError', the role 'errors_ForeignError3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Table', the role 'errors_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ColumnFk' and 'errors_Table'. From 'errors_ColumnFk', the role 'errors_ColumnFk' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_Table', the role 'errors_Table6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ColumnCk' and 'errors_CheckError'. From 'errors_ColumnCk', the role 'errors_ColumnCk' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_CheckError', the role 'errors_CheckError' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errors_ValueCk' and 'errors_ColumnCk'. From 'errors_ValueCk', the role 'errors_ValueCk' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errors_ColumnCk', the role 'errors_ColumnCk9' has cardinality 0..*.
