The domain model 'relational' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'Field' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relational_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'relational_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'relational_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'relational_PrimaryKey' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'relational_Field' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'relational_DataBase' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'port', which is of type int; 'uri', which is of type str.

'relational_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'NUMERIC', 'TIME', 'BOOLEAN', 'VARCHAR', 'FLOAT', 'DATE', 'CHAR'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'relational_PrimaryKey' is a specialization of 'Field'.
The class 'relational_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'Field'.
The class 'relational_Column' is a specialization of 'Field'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'relational_Schema' and 'relational_DataBase'. From 'relational_Schema', the role 'relational_Schema' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_DataBase', the role 'relational_DataBase' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relational_Schema' and 'relational_Table'. From 'relational_Schema', the role 'relational_Schema2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_Table', the role 'relational_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relational_Field' and 'relational_Table'. From 'relational_Field', the role 'relational_Field' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_Table', the role 'relational_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relational_ForeignKey' and 'relational_Table'. From 'relational_ForeignKey', the role 'relational_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_Table', the role 'relational_Table6' has cardinality 0..*.
