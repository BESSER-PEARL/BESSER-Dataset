Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'CSFitType' defines the following possible values: 'FIT_TO_CHILDREN', 'AUTO_EXPAND'.
The enumeration 'CSOrientation' defines the following possible values: 'VERTICAL', 'HORIZONTAL'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'cs_CSRoot' is a specialization of 'CSElement'.
The class 'cs_CSElement' is a specialization of 'ENamedElement'.
The class 'cs_CSNode' is a specialization of 'CSElement'.
The class 'cs_CSConnection' is a specialization of 'CSElement'.
The class 'cs_CSText' is a specialization of 'CSNode'.
The class 'cs_CSShape' is a specialization of 'ENamedElement'.
The class 'cs_CSTemplateDescription' is a specialization of 'CSNode'.
