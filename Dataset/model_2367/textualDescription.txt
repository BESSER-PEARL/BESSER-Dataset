The domain model 'relational_obeo' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'relational_obeo_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'relational_obeo_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'url', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'relational_obeo_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isUnique', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str; 'isPrimaryKey', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relational_obeo_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'relational_obeo_ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'comment', which is of type str.

'relational_obeo_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'NUMERIC', 'VARCHAR', 'FLOAT', 'DATE', 'CHAR', 'TIME'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'relational_obeo_Database' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'relational_obeo_Schema' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'relational_obeo_Table' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'relational_obeo_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'relational_obeo_Column' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'relational_obeo_Database' and 'relational_obeo_Schema'. From 'relational_obeo_Database', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_obeo_Schema', the role 'Schema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relational_obeo_Table' and 'relational_obeo_Schema'. From 'relational_obeo_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_obeo_Schema', the role 'owner2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relational_obeo_Schema' and 'relational_obeo_Database'. From 'relational_obeo_Schema', the role 'ownedSchemas' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relational_obeo_Database', the role 'Database' has cardinality 0..*.
