The domain model 'fc' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'fc_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fc_StringValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'fc_DoubleValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type float.

'fc_IntegerValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'fc_FeatureConfiguration' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'version', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'fc_BooleanValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type bool.

'AttributeValue' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fc_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fc_Selection' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'present', which is of type bool; 'enabled', which is of type bool; 'root', which is of type bool.

'fc_FeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fc_AttributeValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fc_BooleanValue' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.
The class 'fc_IntegerValue' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.
The class 'fc_DoubleValue' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.
The class 'fc_StringValue' is a specialization of 'AttributeValue'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fc_FeatureModel' and 'fc_FeatureConfiguration'. From 'fc_FeatureModel', the role 'fc_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_FeatureConfiguration', the role 'fc_FeatureConfiguration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fc_FeatureModel' and 'fc_FeatureConfiguration'. From 'fc_FeatureModel', the role 'fc_FeatureModel3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_FeatureConfiguration', the role 'fc_FeatureConfiguration2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fc_Selection' and 'fc_FeatureConfiguration'. From 'fc_Selection', the role 'fc_Selection' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_FeatureConfiguration', the role 'fc_FeatureConfiguration5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fc_Selection' and 'fc_Selection'. From 'fc_Selection', the role 'Selection' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_Selection', the role 'selections' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fc_Selection' and 'fc_AttributeValue'. From 'fc_Selection', the role 'selection' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_AttributeValue', the role 'AttributeValue' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fc_Selection' and 'fc_Selection'. From 'fc_Selection', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_Selection', the role 'Selection11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fc_Selection' and 'fc_FeatureConfiguration'. From 'fc_Selection', the role 'fc_Selection13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fc_FeatureConfiguration', the role 'fc_FeatureConfiguration14' has cardinality 0..*.
