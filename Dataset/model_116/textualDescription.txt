Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Visibility' defines the following possible values: 'PUBLIC', 'PROTECTED', 'PRIVATE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dsl_Expression' is a specialization of 'IfStatement'.
The class 'dsl_MemberValue' is a specialization of 'DefaultValue'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
