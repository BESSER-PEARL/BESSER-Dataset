The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_NumberVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'fsm_NumberGuard' is a specialization of 'Guard'.
The class 'fsm_EqualNumberGuard' is a specialization of 'NumberGuard'.
The class 'fsm_AssignValueAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'fsm_LessThanNumberGuard' is a specialization of 'NumberGuard'.
The class 'fsm_GreaterThanNumberGuard' is a specialization of 'NumberGuard'.
The class 'fsm_IncreaseValueAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'fsm_DecreaseValueAction' is a specialization of 'Action'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_StateMachine' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Variable' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_Variable', the role 'fsm_Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_State', the role '8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '11' has cardinality 0..*.
