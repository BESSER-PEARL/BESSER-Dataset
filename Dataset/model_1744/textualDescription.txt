Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'library_Borrowable' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Borrowable', the role 'Borrowable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Customer'. From 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Customer', the role 'library_Customer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Borrowable' and 'library_Customer'. From 'library_Borrowable', the role 'library_Borrowable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Customer', the role 'library_Customer3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Borrowable' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Borrowable', the role 'borrowables' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'Library' has cardinality 0..*.
