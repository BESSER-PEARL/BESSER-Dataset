The domain model 'iritptn' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'iritptn_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'tMax', which is of type int; 'tMin', which is of type int.

'iritptn_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'kind', which is of type str; 'weight', which is of type int.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iritptn_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'iritptn_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'iritptn_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'marking', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ArcKind' defines the following possible values: 'normal', 'readArc'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'iritptn_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'iritptn_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'iritptn_Node' and 'iritptn_PetriNet'. From 'iritptn_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_PetriNet', the role 'net' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_PetriNet' and 'iritptn_Arc'. From 'iritptn_PetriNet', the role 'net2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_Arc' and 'iritptn_Node'. From 'iritptn_Arc', the role 'Arc4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_Arc' and 'iritptn_Node'. From 'iritptn_Arc', the role 'Arc6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_PetriNet' and 'iritptn_Node'. From 'iritptn_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_Arc' and 'iritptn_Node'. From 'iritptn_Arc', the role 'ingoings' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_Node', the role 'Node9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_Arc' and 'iritptn_PetriNet'. From 'iritptn_Arc', the role 'arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iritptn_Node' and 'iritptn_Arc'. From 'iritptn_Node', the role 'Node13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritptn_Arc', the role 'outgoings' has cardinality 0..*.
