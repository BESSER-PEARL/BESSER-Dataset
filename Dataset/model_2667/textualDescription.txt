The domain model 'semlink' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'semlink_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'semlink_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'semlink_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'semlink_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'semlink_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'semlink_G' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'semlink_A' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'semlink_C' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'semlink_B' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'semlink_G' and 'semlink_G'. From 'semlink_G', the role 'semlink_G' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_G', the role 'semlink_G0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'semlink_A' and 'semlink_G'. From 'semlink_A', the role 'semlink_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_G', the role 'semlink_G3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'semlink_G' and 'semlink_C'. From 'semlink_G', the role 'semlink_G5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_C', the role 'semlink_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'semlink_C' and 'semlink_A'. From 'semlink_C', the role 'semlink_C8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_A', the role 'semlink_A7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'semlink_B' and 'semlink_A'. From 'semlink_B', the role 'semlink_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_A', the role 'semlink_A10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'semlink_A' and 'semlink_B'. From 'semlink_A', the role 'semlink_A13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_B', the role 'semlink_B12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'semlink_C' and 'semlink_B'. From 'semlink_C', the role 'semlink_C16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'semlink_B', the role 'semlink_B15' has cardinality 0..*.
