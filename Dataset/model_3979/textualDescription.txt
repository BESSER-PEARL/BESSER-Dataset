It has the following attributes: 'description', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'dtmc_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'probability', which is of type str.

'dtmc_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isStart', which is of type bool; 'isEnd', which is of type bool; 'isFail', which is of type bool.

'dtmc_StandardTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dtmc_Dtmc' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dtmc_Dtmc' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'dtmc_Node' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'dtmc_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'dtmc_SynchronizedTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'dtmc_Module' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'dtmc_CallTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'dtmc_InvokedTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'dtmc_StandardTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dtmc_Dtmc' and 'dtmc_Module'. From 'dtmc_Dtmc', the role 'dtmc_Dtmc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dtmc_Module', the role 'dtmc_Module' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dtmc_Node' and 'dtmc_Module'. From 'dtmc_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dtmc_Module', the role 'Module' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dtmc_Node' and 'dtmc_Transition'. From 'dtmc_Node', the role '_from' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dtmc_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
