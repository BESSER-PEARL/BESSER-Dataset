The domain model 'Sql' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Sql_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Sql_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Sql_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'Sql_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Sql_Database' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'Sql_Table' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'Sql_Column' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Sql_Database' and 'Sql_Table'. From 'Sql_Database', the role 'Sql_Database' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Sql_Table', the role 'Sql_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Sql_Column' and 'Sql_Table'. From 'Sql_Column', the role 'Sql_Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Sql_Table', the role 'Sql_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
