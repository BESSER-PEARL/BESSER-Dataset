The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'gtrace_TRequirementTrace' is a specialization of 'TTrace'.
The class 'gtrace_TScenarioTrace' is a specialization of 'TTrace'.
The class 'gtrace_TScenarioStepTrace' is a specialization of 'TTrace'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
