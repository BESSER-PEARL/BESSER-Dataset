'remember_Customer' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'customerId', which is of type str.

'remember_InvoiceSpecification' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'month', which is of type int.

'remember_Folder' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'remember_Folder' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'remember_Task' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'remember_Folder' and 'remember_Task'. From 'remember_Folder', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'remember_Task', the role 'Task' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'remember_Folder' and 'remember_Folder'. From 'remember_Folder', the role 'parent3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'remember_Folder', the role 'Folder' has cardinality 0..*.
