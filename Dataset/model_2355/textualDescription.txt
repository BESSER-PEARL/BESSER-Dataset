The domain model 'RDBMS' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'RDBMS_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'RDBMS_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'RDBMS_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'RDBMS_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'RDBMS_Key' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'RDBMS_Table' and 'RDBMS_Schema'. From 'RDBMS_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RDBMS_Schema', the role 'schema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RDBMS_Schema' and 'RDBMS_ForeignKey'. From 'RDBMS_Schema', the role 'schema2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RDBMS_ForeignKey', the role 'ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RDBMS_Table' and 'RDBMS_Schema'. From 'RDBMS_Table', the role 'table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RDBMS_Schema', the role 'Schema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RDBMS_Column' and 'RDBMS_Table'. From 'RDBMS_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RDBMS_Table', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RDBMS_Table' and 'RDBMS_Key'. From 'RDBMS_Table', the role 'owner6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RDBMS_Key', the role 'Key' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'RDBMS_Table' and 'RDBMS_ForeignKey'. From 'RDBMS_Table', the role 'owner8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RDBMS_ForeignKey', the role 'ForeignKey9' has cardinality 0..*.
