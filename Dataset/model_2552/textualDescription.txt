The domain model 'Tree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'Tree_Tree' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Tree_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Tree_Tree' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Tree_Node' and 'Tree_Node'. From 'Tree_Node', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Tree_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Tree_Node' and 'Tree_Node'. From 'Tree_Node', the role 'childs' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Tree_Node', the role 'Node4' has cardinality 0..*.
