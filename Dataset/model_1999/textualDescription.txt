Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AbstractionLevel' defines the following possible values: 'CODE', 'PDM', 'CIM', 'PSM', 'PIM', 'ANNOTATION', 'UNSPECIFIED'.
The enumeration 'Mode' defines the following possible values: 'Automatic', 'Manual'.
The enumeration 'Aspect' defines the following possible values: 'Unspecified', 'Content', 'Architecture', 'Semantics', 'Interface', 'Quality', 'Behaviour'.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'Annotation', 'Transformation'.
The enumeration 'ModelType' defines the following possible values: 'Both', 'None', 'Source', 'Target'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'iTrace_M2MLink' is a specialization of 'TraceLink'.
The class 'iTrace_M2TLink' is a specialization of 'TraceLink'.
The class 'iTrace_Code' is a specialization of 'Artefact'.
The class 'iTrace_Model' is a specialization of 'Artefact'.
The class 'iTrace_SourceElement' is a specialization of 'TraceLinkElement'.
The class 'iTrace_TargetElement' is a specialization of 'TraceLinkElement'.
