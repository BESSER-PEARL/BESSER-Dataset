Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Comparation' defines the following possible values: 'Less', 'NotEqual', 'Greater', 'Equal'.
The enumeration 'Protocol' defines the following possible values: 'Akka', 'Paho'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
