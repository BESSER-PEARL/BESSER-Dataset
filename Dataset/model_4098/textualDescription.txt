The domain model 'railway' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'railway_RailwayElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'railway_Semaphore' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'signal', which is of type str.

'railway_Switch' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'currentPosition', which is of type str.

'TrackElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RailwayElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_SwitchPosition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'position', which is of type str.

'railway_Route' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_TrackElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_Segment' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'length', which is of type int.

'railway_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_RailwayContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Signal' defines the following possible values: 'GO', 'STOP', 'FAILURE'.
The enumeration 'Position' defines the following possible values: 'RIGHT', 'LEFT', 'FAILURE', 'STRAIGHT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'railway_Segment' is a specialization of 'TrackElement'.
The class 'railway_TrackElement' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Switch' is a specialization of 'TrackElement'.
The class 'railway_Route' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Semaphore' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_SwitchPosition' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Sensor' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'railway_Sensor' and 'railway_TrackElement'. From 'railway_Sensor', the role 'Sensor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_TrackElement', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_TrackElement' and 'railway_TrackElement'. From 'railway_TrackElement', the role 'railway_TrackElement1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_TrackElement', the role 'railway_TrackElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_Switch' and 'railway_SwitchPosition'. From 'railway_Switch', the role 'switch' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_SwitchPosition', the role 'SwitchPosition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_Semaphore' and 'railway_Route'. From 'railway_Semaphore', the role 'railway_Semaphore' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Route', the role 'railway_Route' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_Route' and 'railway_SwitchPosition'. From 'railway_Route', the role 'route' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_SwitchPosition', the role 'SwitchPosition6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_Semaphore' and 'railway_Route'. From 'railway_Semaphore', the role 'railway_Semaphore9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Route', the role 'railway_Route8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_Route' and 'railway_Sensor'. From 'railway_Route', the role 'railway_Route11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Sensor', the role 'railway_Sensor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_Switch' and 'railway_SwitchPosition'. From 'railway_Switch', the role 'Switch' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_SwitchPosition', the role 'positions' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_SwitchPosition' and 'railway_Route'. From 'railway_SwitchPosition', the role 'follows' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Route', the role 'Route' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_TrackElement' and 'railway_Sensor'. From 'railway_TrackElement', the role 'TrackElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Sensor', the role 'sensor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_RailwayContainer' and 'railway_RailwayElement'. From 'railway_RailwayContainer', the role 'railway_RailwayContainer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_RailwayElement', the role 'railway_RailwayElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_RailwayContainer' and 'railway_Semaphore'. From 'railway_RailwayContainer', the role 'railway_RailwayContainer17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Semaphore', the role 'railway_Semaphore18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'railway_RailwayContainer' and 'railway_Route'. From 'railway_RailwayContainer', the role 'railway_RailwayContainer20' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'railway_Route', the role 'railway_Route21' has cardinality 0..*.
