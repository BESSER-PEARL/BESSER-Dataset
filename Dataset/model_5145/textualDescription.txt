The domain model 'b' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'b_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'z', which is of type str.

'b_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'y', which is of type bool.

'b_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'x', which is of type str.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'b_C' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'b_B' and 'b_B'. From 'b_B', the role 'b_B0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'b_B', the role 'b_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'b_A' and 'b_B'. From 'b_A', the role 'b_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'b_B', the role 'b_B3' has cardinality 0..*.
