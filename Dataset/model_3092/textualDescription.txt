The domain model 'PrimitiveTypes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleClass_NonReferencedClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleClass_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'SimpleClass_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'SimpleClass_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'is_primary', which is of type str.

'SimpleClass_PrimitiveDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleClass_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'is_persistent', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SimpleClass_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'SimpleClass_PrimitiveDataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimpleClass_Class' and 'Class'. From 'SimpleClass_Class', the role 'SimpleClass_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleClass_Class' and 'Attribute'. From 'SimpleClass_Class', the role 'SimpleClass_Class2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleClass_Association' and 'Class'. From 'SimpleClass_Association', the role 'SimpleClass_Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class', the role 'Class4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleClass_Association' and 'Class'. From 'SimpleClass_Association', the role 'SimpleClass_Association6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class', the role 'Class7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Classifier' and 'SimpleClass_Attribute'. From 'Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleClass_Attribute', the role 'SimpleClass_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Class' and 'SimpleClass_Attribute'. From 'Class', the role 'Class11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleClass_Attribute', the role 'SimpleClass_Attribute10' has cardinality 0..*.
