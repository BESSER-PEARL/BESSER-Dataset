Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'architecture_AnalysedElement' and 'architecture_Relationship'. From 'architecture_AnalysedElement', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'architecture_Relationship', the role 'Relationship' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'architecture_Relationship' and 'architecture_AnalysedElement'. From 'architecture_Relationship', the role 'Relationship2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'architecture_AnalysedElement', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'architecture_AnalysedElement' and 'architecture_AnalysedElement'. From 'architecture_AnalysedElement', the role 'AnalysedElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'architecture_AnalysedElement', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*.
