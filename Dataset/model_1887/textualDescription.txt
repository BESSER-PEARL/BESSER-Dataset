The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pycom_ConditionalAction' is a specialization of 'ExpMember'.
The class 'pycom_Actuator' is a specialization of 'BoardMember'.
The class 'pycom_Communication' is a specialization of 'BoardMember'.
The class 'pycom_Function' is a specialization of 'ExpMember'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
