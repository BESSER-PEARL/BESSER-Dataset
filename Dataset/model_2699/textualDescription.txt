The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'model_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_B' and 'model_A'. From 'model_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_A', the role 'a' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_C' and 'model_B'. From 'model_C', the role 'model_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_B', the role 'model_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_B' and 'model_A'. From 'model_B', the role 'b' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_A', the role 'A' has cardinality 0..*.
