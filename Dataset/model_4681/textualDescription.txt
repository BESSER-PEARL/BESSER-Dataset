The domain model 'imp' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 19 main class(es).

'imp_IntConst' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'imp_IntValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'Stmt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'imp_Unary' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'op', which is of type str.

'Expr' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'imp_StringToValueMap' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'key', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'UnaryOp' defines the following possible values: 'NOT', 'NEGATE'.
The enumeration 'BinaryOp' defines the following possible values: 'ADD', 'LEQ', 'GEQ', 'SUB', 'OR', 'GT', 'AND', 'MUL', 'EQ', 'LT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'imp_Skip' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.
The class 'imp_Assign' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.
The class 'imp_Block' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.
The class 'imp_If' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.
The class 'imp_While' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.
The class 'imp_IntConst' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'imp_Var' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'imp_Unary' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'imp_Binary' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'imp_IntValue' is a specialization of 'Value'.
The class 'imp_BoolValue' is a specialization of 'Value'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'imp_Assign' and 'imp_Expr'. From 'imp_Assign', the role 'imp_Assign' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Expr', the role 'imp_Expr' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_Block' and 'imp_Stmt'. From 'imp_Block', the role 'imp_Block' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Stmt', the role 'imp_Stmt' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_Expr' and 'imp_If'. From 'imp_Expr', the role 'imp_Expr3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_If', the role 'imp_If' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_Stmt' and 'imp_If'. From 'imp_Stmt', the role 'imp_Stmt6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_If', the role 'imp_If5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_If' and 'imp_Stmt'. From 'imp_If', the role 'imp_If8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Stmt', the role 'imp_Stmt9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_While' and 'imp_Expr'. From 'imp_While', the role 'imp_While' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Expr', the role 'imp_Expr11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_While' and 'imp_Stmt'. From 'imp_While', the role 'imp_While13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Stmt', the role 'imp_Stmt14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_Expr' and 'imp_Unary'. From 'imp_Expr', the role 'imp_Expr16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Unary', the role 'imp_Unary' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'imp_Expr' and 'imp_Binary'. From 'imp_Expr', the role 'imp_Expr18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'imp_Binary', the role 'imp_Binary' has cardinality 0..*.
