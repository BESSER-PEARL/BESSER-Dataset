The domain model 'di' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'ContainerShape' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Link' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_ContainerShape' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'DiNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'di_DiNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'modelElement', which is of type str.

'di_Shape' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'height', which is of type int; 'x', which is of type int; 'y', which is of type int; 'width', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'di_ContainerShape' is a specialization of 'DiNode'.
The class 'di_Shape' is a specialization of 'ContainerShape'.
The class 'di_Link' is a specialization of 'DiNode'.
The class 'di_Diagram' is a specialization of 'ContainerShape'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'di_ContainerShape' and 'di_Shape'. From 'di_ContainerShape', the role 'di_ContainerShape' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Shape', the role 'di_Shape' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_Shape' and 'di_Link'. From 'di_Shape', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Link', the role 'Link' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_Link' and 'di_Shape'. From 'di_Link', the role 'Link3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Shape', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_Link' and 'di_Shape'. From 'di_Link', the role 'targetLinks' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Shape', the role 'Shape' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_Link' and 'di_Shape'. From 'di_Link', the role 'sourceLinks' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Shape', the role 'Shape6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_Diagram' and 'di_Link'. From 'di_Diagram', the role 'di_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Link', the role 'di_Link' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'di_DiNode'. From 'di_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'di_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_DiNode', the role 'di_DiNode' has cardinality 0..*.
