The domain model 'simpleworld' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'simpleworld_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleworld_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simpleworld_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'simpleworld_World' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simpleworld_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'simpleworld_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpleworld_World' and 'simpleworld_Thing'. From 'simpleworld_World', the role 'simpleworld_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleworld_Thing', the role 'simpleworld_Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleworld_RelatedTo' and 'simpleworld_Thing'. From 'simpleworld_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleworld_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleworld_RelatedTo' and 'simpleworld_Thing'. From 'simpleworld_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleworld_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleworld_RelatedTo' and 'simpleworld_Thing'. From 'simpleworld_RelatedTo', the role 'simpleworld_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleworld_Thing', the role 'simpleworld_Thing4' has cardinality 0..*.
