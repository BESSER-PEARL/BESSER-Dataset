The domain model 'basic' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'basic_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'basic_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'basic_World' represents an important domain concept.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'basic_Thing' and 'basic_World'. From 'basic_Thing', the role 'basic_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basic_World', the role 'basic_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'basic_Thing' and 'basic_RelatedTo'. From 'basic_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basic_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'basic_Thing' and 'basic_RelatedTo'. From 'basic_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basic_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'basic_RelatedTo' and 'basic_Thing'. From 'basic_RelatedTo', the role 'basic_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'basic_Thing', the role 'basic_Thing4' has cardinality 0..*.
