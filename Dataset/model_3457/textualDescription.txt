The domain model 'featureModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 20 main class(es).

'featureModel_IntValue' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mandatory', which is of type bool; 'unselected', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str; 'selected', which is of type bool.

'featureModel_Excludes' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_FeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'featureModel_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'runtime', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SelectionOperator' defines the following possible values: 'deselect', 'select'.
The enumeration 'ComparisonOperator' defines the following possible values: 'equal', 'geq', 'lt', 'gt', 'leq'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featureModel_Feature' is a specialization of 'VariabilityElement'.
The class 'featureModel_Exclusive' is a specialization of 'Alternative'.
The class 'featureModel_Alternative' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'featureModel_Attribute' is a specialization of 'VariabilityElement'.
The class 'featureModel_BooleanConstraint' is a specialization of 'FMConstraint'.
The class 'featureModel_Implies' is a specialization of 'BooleanConstraint'.
The class 'featureModel_Excludes' is a specialization of 'BooleanConstraint'.
The class 'featureModel_AdaptationRule' is a specialization of 'FMConstraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'featureModel_FMConstraint' and 'featureModel_FeatureModel'. From 'featureModel_FMConstraint', the role 'featureModel_FMConstraint' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'featureModel_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_FeatureModel' and 'featureModel_Feature'. From 'featureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'featureModel_FeatureModel2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Feature', the role 'featureModel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_Feature' and 'featureModel_Attribute'. From 'featureModel_Feature', the role 'featureModel_Feature4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Attribute', the role 'featureModel_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
