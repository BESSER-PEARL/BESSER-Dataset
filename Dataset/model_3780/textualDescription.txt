Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BinaryOperator' defines the following possible values: 'OR', 'AND'.
The enumeration 'GroupType' defines the following possible values: 'XOR', 'OR'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
