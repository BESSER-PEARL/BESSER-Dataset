Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'idm_StateMachine' and 'idm_State'. From 'idm_StateMachine', the role 'idm_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'idm_State', the role 'idm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'idm_StateMachine' and 'idm_Transition'. From 'idm_StateMachine', the role 'idm_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'idm_Transition', the role 'idm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'idm_State' and 'idm_Transition'. From 'idm_State', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'idm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'idm_State' and 'idm_Transition'. From 'idm_State', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'idm_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'idm_State' and 'idm_Transition'. From 'idm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'idm_Transition', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'idm_State' and 'idm_Transition'. From 'idm_State', the role 'State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'idm_Transition', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*.
