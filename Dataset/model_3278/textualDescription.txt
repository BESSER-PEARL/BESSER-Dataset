An association connects 'sm_Variable' and 'sm_State'. From 'sm_Variable', the role 'sm_Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sm_State', the role 'sm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sm_StateMachine' and 'sm_State'. From 'sm_StateMachine', the role 'sm_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sm_State', the role 'sm_State2' has cardinality 0..*.
