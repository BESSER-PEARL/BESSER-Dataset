Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BookCategory' defines the following possible values: 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'ScienceFiction'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'library_Book' is a specialization of 'CirculatingItem'.

The class 'library_Writer' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'library_CirculatingItem' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'library_CirculatingItem' is a specialization of 'Lendable'.
The class 'library_Periodical' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'library_AudioVisualItem' is a specialization of 'CirculatingItem'.
The class 'library_BookOnTape' is a specialization of 'AudioVisualItem'.
The class 'library_VideoCassette' is a specialization of 'AudioVisualItem'.
The class 'library_Borrower' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'library_Person' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'library_Employee' is a specialization of 'Person'.
