The domain model 'Kasu2' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'Kasu2_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Kasu2_ClassA' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

'Kasu2_ClassB' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Kasu2_ClassB' and 'Kasu2_ClassA'. From 'Kasu2_ClassB', the role 'ClassB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Kasu2_ClassA', the role 'C_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Kasu2_ClassA' and 'Kasu2_Root'. From 'Kasu2_ClassA', the role 'C_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Kasu2_Root', the role 'Root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Kasu2_ClassA' and 'Kasu2_ClassB'. From 'Kasu2_ClassA', the role 'ClassA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Kasu2_ClassB', the role 'C_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Kasu2_Root' and 'Kasu2_ClassA'. From 'Kasu2_Root', the role 'C_R' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Kasu2_ClassA', the role 'ClassA5' has cardinality 0..*.
