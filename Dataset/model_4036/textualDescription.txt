The domain model 'uml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 24 main class(es).

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VisibilityKind' defines the following possible values: 'private', 'package', 'protected', 'public'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'uml_Parameter' and 'uml_Operation'. From 'uml_Parameter', the role 'uml_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Operation', the role 'uml_Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Behavior' and 'uml_Operation'. From 'uml_Behavior', the role 'uml_Behavior' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Operation', the role 'uml_Operation2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Classifier' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_Classifier', the role 'uml_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
