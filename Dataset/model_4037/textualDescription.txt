'uml_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isAbstract', which is of type str.

'uml_Property' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VisibilityKind' defines the following possible values: 'private', 'protected', 'public', 'package'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'uml_Parameter' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'uml_Model' is a specialization of 'Package'.
The class 'uml_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Package' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.
The class 'uml_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_PackageableElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Property' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'uml_Property' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'uml_Property' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Dependency' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.
The class 'uml_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'uml_Operation' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'uml_Operation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Classifier' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'uml_Classifier' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Behavior' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'uml_TypedElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Type' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'uml_Package' and 'uml_PackageableElement'. From 'uml_Package', the role 'uml_Package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_PackageableElement', the role 'uml_PackageableElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_NamedElement' and 'uml_Dependency'. From 'uml_NamedElement', the role 'uml_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Dependency', the role 'uml_Dependency' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Classifier' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_Classifier', the role 'uml_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Operation' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_Operation', the role 'uml_Operation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Class' and 'uml_Classifier'. From 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Classifier', the role 'uml_Classifier7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Class' and 'uml_Property'. From 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Property', the role 'uml_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
