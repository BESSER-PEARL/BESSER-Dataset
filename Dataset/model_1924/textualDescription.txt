Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'BibTeX_BibTeXFile' and 'BibTeX_BibTeXEntry'. From 'BibTeX_BibTeXFile', the role 'BibTeX_BibTeXFile' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BibTeX_BibTeXEntry', the role 'BibTeX_BibTeXEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'BibTeX_AuthoredEntry' and 'BibTeX_Author'. From 'BibTeX_AuthoredEntry', the role 'BibTeX_AuthoredEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'BibTeX_Author', the role 'BibTeX_Author' has cardinality 0..*.
