The domain model 'errya' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'errya_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'errya_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errya_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errya_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'errya_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'errya_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'errya_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'errya_Thing' and 'errya_World'. From 'errya_Thing', the role 'errya_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errya_World', the role 'errya_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errya_RelatedTo' and 'errya_Thing'. From 'errya_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errya_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errya_Alias' and 'errya_NamedElement'. From 'errya_Alias', the role 'errya_Alias' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errya_NamedElement', the role 'errya_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errya_RelatedTo' and 'errya_Thing'. From 'errya_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errya_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errya_Thing' and 'errya_RelatedTo'. From 'errya_Thing', the role 'errya_Thing5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errya_RelatedTo', the role 'errya_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
