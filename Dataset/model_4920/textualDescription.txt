The class 'web_service_GenericFunctionProvider' is a specialization of 'FunctionProvider'.
The class 'web_service_GenericDataRecogniser' is a specialization of 'DataRecogniser'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'web_service_Service' and 'web_service_Endpoint'. From 'web_service_Service', the role 'web_service_Service' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'web_service_Endpoint', the role 'web_service_Endpoint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'web_service_MessageFormatter' and 'web_service_Endpoint'. From 'web_service_MessageFormatter', the role 'web_service_MessageFormatter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'web_service_Endpoint', the role 'web_service_Endpoint2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'web_service_Endpoint' and 'web_service_FunctionProvider'. From 'web_service_Endpoint', the role 'web_service_Endpoint4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'web_service_FunctionProvider', the role 'web_service_FunctionProvider' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'web_service_Endpoint' and 'web_service_DataRecogniser'. From 'web_service_Endpoint', the role 'web_service_Endpoint6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'web_service_DataRecogniser', the role 'web_service_DataRecogniser' has cardinality 0..*.
