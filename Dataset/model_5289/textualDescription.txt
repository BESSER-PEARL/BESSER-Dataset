The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'refinher3_E' is a specialization of 'DNamedElement'.
The class 'refinher3_DL' is a specialization of 'CE'.
The class 'refinher3_DR' is a specialization of 'E'.
The class 'refinher3_DC' is a specialization of 'CE'.
The class 'refinher3_A' is a specialization of 'DNamedElement'.
The class 'refinher3_CE' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'refinher3_CE' is a specialization of 'E'.
The class 'refinher3_BB' is a specialization of 'DNamedElement'.
The class 'refinher3_Foobar' is a specialization of 'DNamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'refinher3_E' and 'refinher3_N'. From 'refinher3_E', the role 'refinher3_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_N', the role 'refinher3_N' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_E' and 'refinher3_N'. From 'refinher3_E', the role 'refinher3_E2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_N', the role 'refinher3_N3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_BB' and 'refinher3_DL'. From 'refinher3_BB', the role 'refinher3_BB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_DL', the role 'refinher3_DL' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_BB' and 'refinher3_DG'. From 'refinher3_BB', the role 'refinher3_BB6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_DG', the role 'refinher3_DG' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_N' and 'refinher3_DG'. From 'refinher3_N', the role 'refinher3_N9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_DG', the role 'refinher3_DG8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_M' and 'refinher3_DG'. From 'refinher3_M', the role 'refinher3_M' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_DG', the role 'refinher3_DG11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_E' and 'refinher3_M'. From 'refinher3_E', the role 'refinher3_E14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_M', the role 'refinher3_M13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refinher3_Foobar' and 'refinher3_M'. From 'refinher3_Foobar', the role 'refinher3_Foobar' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refinher3_M', the role 'refinher3_M16' has cardinality 0..*.
