The domain model 'petriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'petriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'typeArc', which is of type str; 'poids', which is of type int.

'petriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_PetriNetElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'jeton', which is of type int.

'PetriNetElt' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petriNet_Noeud' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Noeud' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TypeArc' defines the following possible values: 'ArcSimple', 'ReadArc'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Noeud'.
The class 'petriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Noeud'.
The class 'petriNet_Noeud' is a specialization of 'PetriNetElt'.
The class 'petriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'PetriNetElt'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petriNet_Arc' and 'petriNet_Noeud'. From 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Noeud', the role 'predecesseur' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Arc' and 'petriNet_Noeud'. From 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Noeud', the role 'successeur' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Arc' and 'petriNet_Noeud'. From 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'noeudsSuccesseurs' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Noeud', the role 'Noeud' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Noeud' and 'petriNet_Arc'. From 'petriNet_Noeud', the role 'Noeud5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'noeudsPredecesseurs' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_PetriNetElt' and 'petriNet_PetriNet'. From 'petriNet_PetriNetElt', the role 'petriNet_PetriNetElt' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'petriNet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_PetriNetElt' and 'petriNet_PetriNet'. From 'petriNet_PetriNetElt', the role 'petriNet_PetriNetElt9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'petriNet_PetriNet8' has cardinality 0..*.
