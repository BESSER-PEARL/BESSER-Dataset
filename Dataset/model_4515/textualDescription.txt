Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Operator' defines the following possible values: 'superior', 'inferior', 'equal'.
The enumeration 'Precision' defines the following possible values: 's', 'ms', 'm'.
The enumeration 'Activity' defines the following possible values: 'sitting', 'laying', 'standing'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'smarthome_Tag' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'smarthome_Room' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'smarthome_Pattern' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'smarthome_Person' is a specialization of 'NamedEntity'.
The class 'smarthome_SensorPredicate' is a specialization of 'Predicate'.
The class 'smarthome_PersonPredicate' is a specialization of 'Predicate'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smarthome_Room' and 'smarthome_Home'. From 'smarthome_Room', the role 'smarthome_Room' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smarthome_Home', the role 'smarthome_Home' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smarthome_Person' and 'smarthome_Home'. From 'smarthome_Person', the role 'smarthome_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smarthome_Home', the role 'smarthome_Home2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smarthome_Home' and 'smarthome_Pattern'. From 'smarthome_Home', the role 'smarthome_Home4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smarthome_Pattern', the role 'smarthome_Pattern' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smarthome_Home' and 'smarthome_NamedEntity'. From 'smarthome_Home', the role 'smarthome_Home6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smarthome_NamedEntity', the role 'smarthome_NamedEntity' has cardinality 0..*.
