The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Primary' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Parenthesis' is a specialization of 'Primary'.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Number' is a specialization of 'Primary'.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Plus' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Minus' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Mult' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'mathInterpeter_Div' is a specialization of 'Exp'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
