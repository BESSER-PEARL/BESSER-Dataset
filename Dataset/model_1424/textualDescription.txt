The domain model 'errorstm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'errorstm_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errorstm_SimpleState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errorstm_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'errorstm_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errorstm_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errorstm_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'errorstm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'event', which is of type str; 'guard', which is of type str.

'errorstm_CompositeState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ActionKind' defines the following possible values: 'EXIT', 'ENTRY'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'errorstm_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'errorstm_InitialState' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'errorstm_SimpleState' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'errorstm_FinalState' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'errorstm_AbstractState' and 'errorstm_Transition'. From 'errorstm_AbstractState', the role 'AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorstm_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorstm_AbstractState' and 'errorstm_Transition'. From 'errorstm_AbstractState', the role 'AbstractState2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorstm_Transition', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorstm_Transition' and 'errorstm_AbstractState'. From 'errorstm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorstm_AbstractState', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorstm_AbstractState' and 'errorstm_Transition'. From 'errorstm_AbstractState', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorstm_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
