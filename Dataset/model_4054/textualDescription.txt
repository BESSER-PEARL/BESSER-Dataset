The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'smalluml_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Method' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Association' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Heritage' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Role' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Type' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Float' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Int' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Boolean' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_String' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smalluml_Class' and 'smalluml_Method'. From 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Method', the role 'smalluml_Method' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Type' and 'smalluml_Class'. From 'smalluml_Type', the role 'smalluml_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Type' and 'smalluml_Method'. From 'smalluml_Type', the role 'smalluml_Type5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Method', the role 'smalluml_Method4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Type' and 'smalluml_Method'. From 'smalluml_Type', the role 'smalluml_Type8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Method', the role 'smalluml_Method7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Role' and 'smalluml_Association'. From 'smalluml_Role', the role 'smalluml_Role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Association', the role 'smalluml_Association' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Role' and 'smalluml_Association'. From 'smalluml_Role', the role 'smalluml_Role12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Association', the role 'smalluml_Association11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Heritage' and 'smalluml_Role'. From 'smalluml_Heritage', the role 'smalluml_Heritage' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Role', the role 'smalluml_Role14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Heritage' and 'smalluml_Role'. From 'smalluml_Heritage', the role 'smalluml_Heritage16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Role', the role 'smalluml_Role17' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Role' and 'smalluml_Class'. From 'smalluml_Role', the role 'smalluml_Role19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class20' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Association' and 'smalluml_Diagram'. From 'smalluml_Association', the role 'smalluml_Association22' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Diagram', the role 'smalluml_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Heritage' and 'smalluml_Diagram'. From 'smalluml_Heritage', the role 'smalluml_Heritage25' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Diagram', the role 'smalluml_Diagram24' has cardinality 0..*.
