The domain model 'arduinoml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'arduinoml_Brick' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'pin', which is of type int.

'arduinoml_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'arduinoml_On' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Action' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_Trigger' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'arduinoml_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_Off' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Brick' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_Wait' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'waitingTime', which is of type int.

'arduinoml_Board' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_Actuator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoml_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DigitalValue' defines the following possible values: 'OFF', 'ON'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'arduinoml_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoml_Brick' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoml_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoml_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoml_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoml_Off' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'arduinoml_On' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'arduinoml_Wait' is a specialization of 'Action'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'arduinoml_Board' and 'arduinoml_State'. From 'arduinoml_Board', the role 'arduinoml_Board' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoml_State', the role 'arduinoml_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoml_State' and 'arduinoml_Board'. From 'arduinoml_State', the role 'arduinoml_State3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoml_Board', the role 'arduinoml_Board2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoml_Brick' and 'arduinoml_Board'. From 'arduinoml_Brick', the role 'arduinoml_Brick' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoml_Board', the role 'arduinoml_Board5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoml_Action' and 'arduinoml_State'. From 'arduinoml_Action', the role 'arduinoml_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoml_State', the role 'arduinoml_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoml_Transition' and 'arduinoml_State'. From 'arduinoml_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoml_State', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
