Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Speed' defines the following possible values: 'SIXTY', 'FOURTY', 'ZERO', 'TWENTY'.
The enumeration 'TurnoutDirection' defines the following possible values: 'STRAIGHT', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.
The enumeration 'ConnectionDirection' defines the following possible values: 'TOP', 'RIGHT', 'STRAIGHT', 'LEFT'.
