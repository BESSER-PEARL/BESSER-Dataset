The domain model 'slolpBPM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'slolpBPM_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'slolpBPM_DomainModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'slolpBPM_Datatype' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'slolpBPM_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'many', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'slolpBPM_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'slolpBPM_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'slolpBPM_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'slolpBPM_DomainModel' and 'slolpBPM_Type'. From 'slolpBPM_DomainModel', the role 'slolpBPM_DomainModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'slolpBPM_Type', the role 'slolpBPM_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'slolpBPM_Entity' and 'slolpBPM_Entity'. From 'slolpBPM_Entity', the role 'slolpBPM_Entity1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'slolpBPM_Entity', the role 'slolpBPM_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'slolpBPM_Feature' and 'slolpBPM_Entity'. From 'slolpBPM_Feature', the role 'slolpBPM_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'slolpBPM_Entity', the role 'slolpBPM_Entity4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'slolpBPM_Type' and 'slolpBPM_Feature'. From 'slolpBPM_Type', the role 'slolpBPM_Type7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'slolpBPM_Feature', the role 'slolpBPM_Feature6' has cardinality 0..*.
