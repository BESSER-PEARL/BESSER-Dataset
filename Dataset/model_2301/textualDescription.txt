The class 'PersonList_Male' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'PersonList_Female' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PersonList_Person' and 'PersonList_List'. From 'PersonList_Person', the role 'Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonList_List', the role 'list' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PersonList_List' and 'PersonList_Place'. From 'PersonList_List', the role 'PersonList_List' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonList_Place', the role 'PersonList_Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PersonList_Person' and 'PersonList_List'. From 'PersonList_Person', the role 'members' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonList_List', the role 'List' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PersonList_WorkingPosition' and 'PersonList_Person'. From 'PersonList_WorkingPosition', the role 'WorkingPosition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonList_Person', the role 'persons' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PersonList_LivingPlace' and 'PersonList_Person'. From 'PersonList_LivingPlace', the role 'LivingPlace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonList_Person', the role 'persons5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PersonList_WorkPlace' and 'PersonList_WorkingPosition'. From 'PersonList_WorkPlace', the role 'works' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PersonList_WorkingPosition', the role 'WorkingPosition7' has cardinality 0..*.
