It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleRdbms_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'simpleRdbms_RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'kind', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'simpleRdbms_Key' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleRdbms_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simpleRdbms_Schema' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simpleRdbms_Table' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simpleRdbms_Column' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simpleRdbms_Key' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simpleRdbms_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
