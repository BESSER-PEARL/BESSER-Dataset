The domain model 'sgen' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'sgen_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_GeneratorModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'generatorId', which is of type str.

'sgen_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_GeneratorEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'contentType', which is of type str.

'sgen_FeatureParameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'optional', which is of type bool; 'parameterType', which is of type str.

'sgen_FeatureTypeLibrary' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'DeprecatableElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_FeatureType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'optional', which is of type bool.

'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_FeatureConfiguration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sgen_DeprecatableElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'deprecated', which is of type bool; 'comment', which is of type str.

'sgen_FeatureParameterValue' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ParameterTypes' defines the following possible values: 'STRING', 'FLOAT', 'BOOLEAN', 'INTEGER'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sgen_FeatureType' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sgen_FeatureType' is a specialization of 'DeprecatableElement'.
The class 'sgen_FeatureParameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'sgen_FeatureParameter' is a specialization of 'DeprecatableElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sgen_GeneratorEntry' and 'sgen_GeneratorModel'. From 'sgen_GeneratorEntry', the role 'sgen_GeneratorEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sgen_GeneratorModel', the role 'sgen_GeneratorModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sgen_GeneratorModel' and 'sgen_Property'. From 'sgen_GeneratorModel', the role 'sgen_GeneratorModel2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sgen_Property', the role 'sgen_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration' and 'sgen_FeatureConfiguration'. From 'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration', the role 'sgen_GeneratorConfiguration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sgen_FeatureConfiguration', the role 'sgen_FeatureConfiguration' has cardinality 0..*.
