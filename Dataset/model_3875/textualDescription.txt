The domain model 'fl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'Expr' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Literal' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'info', which is of type str.

'fl_DocumentRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'mixed', which is of type str.

'fl_ProgramType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Binary' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ops', which is of type str.

'fl_Function' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'arg', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_IfThenElse' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Argument' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fl_Expr' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Apply' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Ops' defines the following possible values: 'Minus', 'Equal', 'Plus'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fl_Apply' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'fl_Argument' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'fl_Binary' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'fl_IfThenElse' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'fl_Literal' is a specialization of 'Expr'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fl_Apply' and 'fl_Expr'. From 'fl_Apply', the role 'fl_Apply' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Binary' and 'fl_Expr'. From 'fl_Binary', the role 'fl_Binary' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Binary' and 'fl_Expr'. From 'fl_Binary', the role 'fl_Binary4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'fl_DocumentRoot'. From 'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_DocumentRoot', the role 'fl_DocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_DocumentRoot' and 'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'fl_DocumentRoot', the role 'fl_DocumentRoot8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'fl_EStringToStringMapEntry9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_DocumentRoot' and 'fl_Expr'. From 'fl_DocumentRoot', the role 'fl_DocumentRoot11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_ProgramType' and 'fl_DocumentRoot'. From 'fl_ProgramType', the role 'fl_ProgramType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_DocumentRoot', the role 'fl_DocumentRoot14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Expr' and 'fl_Function'. From 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Function', the role 'fl_Function' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_IfThenElse' and 'fl_Expr'. From 'fl_IfThenElse', the role 'fl_IfThenElse' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_IfThenElse' and 'fl_Expr'. From 'fl_IfThenElse', the role 'fl_IfThenElse20' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr21' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Expr' and 'fl_IfThenElse'. From 'fl_Expr', the role 'fl_Expr24' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_IfThenElse', the role 'fl_IfThenElse23' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_ProgramType' and 'fl_Function'. From 'fl_ProgramType', the role 'fl_ProgramType26' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Function', the role 'fl_Function27' has cardinality 0..*.
