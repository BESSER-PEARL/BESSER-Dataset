The domain model 'pn' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'pn_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pn_Net' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'incrementalID', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pn_NetElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pn_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'noOfTokens', which is of type int.

'pn_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'NetElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pn_Net' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'pn_NetElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'pn_Transition' is a specialization of 'NetElement'.
The class 'pn_Place' is a specialization of 'NetElement'.
The class 'pn_Place' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pn_Net' and 'pn_NetElement'. From 'pn_Net', the role 'net' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pn_NetElement', the role 'NetElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pn_NetElement' and 'pn_Net'. From 'pn_NetElement', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pn_Net', the role 'Net' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pn_Place' and 'pn_Transition'. From 'pn_Place', the role 'Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pn_Transition', the role 'srcT2P' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pn_Place' and 'pn_Transition'. From 'pn_Place', the role 'Place4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pn_Transition', the role 'trgP2T' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pn_Place' and 'pn_Transition'. From 'pn_Place', the role 'srcP2T' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pn_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pn_Place' and 'pn_Transition'. From 'pn_Place', the role 'trgT2P' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pn_Transition', the role 'Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
