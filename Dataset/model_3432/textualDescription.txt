The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'school_Math' is a specialization of 'Matter'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'school_Academy' and 'school_Teacher'. From 'school_Academy', the role 'school_Academy' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Teacher', the role 'school_Teacher' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Student' and 'school_Academy'. From 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Academy', the role 'school_Academy2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_School' and 'school_Academy'. From 'school_School', the role 'school_School' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Academy', the role 'school_Academy4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_ClassRoom' and 'school_School'. From 'school_ClassRoom', the role 'school_ClassRoom' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_School', the role 'school_School6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Teacher' and 'school_School'. From 'school_Teacher', the role 'school_Teacher9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_School', the role 'school_School8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Student' and 'school_School'. From 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_School', the role 'school_School11' has cardinality 0..*.
