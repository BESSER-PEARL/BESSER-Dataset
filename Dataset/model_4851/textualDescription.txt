The domain model 'units' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'units_UnitRepository' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'units_BaseUnit' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Unit' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'units_Unit' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'units_UnitCarryingElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'unitSpecification', which is of type str.

'units_UnitMultiplication' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'units_UnitPower' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'exponent', which is of type int.

'units_UnitLiteral' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'units_UnitMultiplication' is a specialization of 'Unit'.
The class 'units_UnitPower' is a specialization of 'Unit'.
The class 'units_UnitLiteral' is a specialization of 'Unit'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'units_Unit' and 'units_UnitCarryingElement'. From 'units_Unit', the role 'units_Unit' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_UnitCarryingElement', the role 'units_UnitCarryingElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_BaseUnit' and 'units_UnitRepository'. From 'units_BaseUnit', the role 'units_BaseUnit' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_UnitRepository', the role 'units_UnitRepository' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_Unit' and 'units_UnitMultiplication'. From 'units_Unit', the role 'units_Unit3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_UnitMultiplication', the role 'units_UnitMultiplication' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_Unit' and 'units_UnitPower'. From 'units_Unit', the role 'units_Unit5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_UnitPower', the role 'units_UnitPower' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_BaseUnit' and 'units_UnitLiteral'. From 'units_BaseUnit', the role 'units_BaseUnit7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_UnitLiteral', the role 'units_UnitLiteral' has cardinality 0..*.
