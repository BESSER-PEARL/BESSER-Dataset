The domain model 'e' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'e_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'c', which is of type int.

'e_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'a', which is of type str; 'b', which is of type str.

'Y' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'e_Z' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'b', which is of type int.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'e_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'a', which is of type str.

'e_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'c', which is of type float.

'e_X' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'e_B' is a specialization of 'Y'.
The class 'e_C' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'e_X' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'e_B' and 'e_A'. From 'e_B', the role 'e_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_A', the role 'e_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'e_B' and 'e_A'. From 'e_B', the role 'e_B3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_A', the role 'e_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'e_B' and 'e_Z'. From 'e_B', the role 'e_B5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_Z', the role 'e_Z' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'e_B' and 'e_C'. From 'e_B', the role 'cc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_C', the role 'C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'e_B' and 'e_C'. From 'e_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_C', the role 'cc8' has cardinality 0..*.
