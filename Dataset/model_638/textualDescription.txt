Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'libraryModel_ecore_Book' and 'libraryModel_ecore_Author'. From 'libraryModel_ecore_Book', the role 'libraryModel_ecore_Book' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'libraryModel_ecore_Author', the role 'libraryModel_ecore_Author' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'libraryModel_ecore_Book' and 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel'. From 'libraryModel_ecore_Book', the role 'book' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel', the role 'LibraryModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'libraryModel_ecore_Book' and 'libraryModel_ecore_Picture'. From 'libraryModel_ecore_Book', the role 'book3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'libraryModel_ecore_Picture', the role 'Picture' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel' and 'libraryModel_ecore_Author'. From 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel', the role 'LibraryModel5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'libraryModel_ecore_Author', the role 'authors' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel' and 'libraryModel_ecore_Book'. From 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel', the role 'library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'libraryModel_ecore_Book', the role 'Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel' and 'libraryModel_ecore_Author'. From 'libraryModel_ecore_LibraryModel', the role 'library8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'libraryModel_ecore_Author', the role 'Author' has cardinality 0..*.
