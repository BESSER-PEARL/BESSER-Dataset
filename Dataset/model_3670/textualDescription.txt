An association connects 'Project_Project' and 'Project_Employee'. From 'Project_Project', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Project_Employee', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Project_Employee' and 'Project_Department'. From 'Project_Employee', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Project_Department', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Project_Project' and 'Project_Department'. From 'Project_Project', the role '10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Project_Department', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Project_Employee' and 'Project_Project'. From 'Project_Employee', the role '13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Project_Project', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Project_Department' and 'Project_Project'. From 'Project_Department', the role '16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Project_Project', the role '15' has cardinality 0..*.
