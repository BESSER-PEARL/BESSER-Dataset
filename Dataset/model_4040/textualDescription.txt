The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classdiagram_Class' is a specialization of 'Typeable'.
The class 'classdiagram_Attribute' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Operation' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_TypedElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Association' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Typeable' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_DataType' is a specialization of 'Typeable'.
The class 'classdiagram_Composition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
