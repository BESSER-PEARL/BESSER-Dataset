The domain model 'TypeA' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'TypeA_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description1', which is of type str; 'description3', which is of type str; 'description2', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeA_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeA_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description1', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'description2', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TypeA_A' and 'TypeA_B'. From 'TypeA_A', the role 'TypeA_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeA_B', the role 'TypeA_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TypeA_A' and 'TypeA_C'. From 'TypeA_A', the role 'TypeA_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeA_C', the role 'TypeA_C' has cardinality 0..*.
