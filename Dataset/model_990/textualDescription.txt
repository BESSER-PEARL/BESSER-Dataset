The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'notation_DiagramElement' is a specialization of 'Identifier'.
The class 'notation_Node' is a specialization of 'DiagramElement'.
The class 'notation_Edge' is a specialization of 'DiagramElement'.
The class 'notation_HierarchicalNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'notation_RelativeBendPoint' is a specialization of 'BendPoint'.
The class 'notation_AbsoluteBendPoint' is a specialization of 'BendPoint'.
