The domain model 'classdiagram' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'is_primary', which is of type bool.

'classdiagram_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'is_persistent', which is of type bool.

'classdiagram_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classdiagram_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classdiagram_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classdiagram_PrimitiveDataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classdiagram_PrimitiveDataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'classdiagram_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Package' and 'classdiagram_Classifier'. From 'classdiagram_Package', the role 'classdiagram_Package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Classifier', the role 'classdiagram_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Association' and 'classdiagram_Package'. From 'classdiagram_Association', the role 'classdiagram_Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Package', the role 'classdiagram_Package2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Attribute' and 'classdiagram_Class'. From 'classdiagram_Attribute', the role 'classdiagram_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Class' and 'classdiagram_Class'. From 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Attribute' and 'classdiagram_Classifier'. From 'classdiagram_Attribute', the role 'classdiagram_Attribute8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Classifier', the role 'classdiagram_Classifier9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Association' and 'classdiagram_Class'. From 'classdiagram_Association', the role 'classdiagram_Association11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classdiagram_Class' and 'classdiagram_Association'. From 'classdiagram_Class', the role 'classdiagram_Class15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classdiagram_Association', the role 'classdiagram_Association14' has cardinality 0..*.
