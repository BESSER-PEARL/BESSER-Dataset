The domain model 'dc' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'dc_Bounds' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'x', which is of type str; 'width', which is of type str; 'y', which is of type str; 'height', which is of type str.

'dc_Point' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'y', which is of type str; 'x', which is of type str.

'dc_Dimension' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'height', which is of type str; 'width', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'KnownColor' defines the following possible values: 'silver', 'white', 'olive', 'blue', 'black', 'green', 'teal', 'purple', 'yellow', 'lime', 'red', 'fuchsia', 'aqua', 'gray', 'navy', 'maroon', 'orange'.
