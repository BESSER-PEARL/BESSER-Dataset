The domain model 'Data' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'Data_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Data_Field' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'modifier', which is of type str.

'Data_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Data_Model' and 'Data_Class'. From 'Data_Model', the role 'Data_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Data_Class', the role 'Data_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Data_Class' and 'Data_Field'. From 'Data_Class', the role 'Data_Class2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Data_Field', the role 'Data_Field' has cardinality 0..*.
