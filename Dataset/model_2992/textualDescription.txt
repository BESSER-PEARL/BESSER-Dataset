The class 'model_SysOp' is a specialization of 'Administrator'.
The class 'model_WikiProject' is a specialization of 'Internal'.
The class 'model_UnregisteredUser' is a specialization of 'Role'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_Content' and 'model_Revision'. From 'model_Content', the role 'model_Content' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Revision', the role 'model_Revision' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Content' and 'model_Discussion'. From 'model_Content', the role 'model_Content2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Discussion', the role 'model_Discussion' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Revision' and 'model_Content'. From 'model_Revision', the role 'model_Revision5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Content', the role 'model_Content4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_VersionHistory' and 'model_Content'. From 'model_VersionHistory', the role 'model_VersionHistory' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Content', the role 'model_Content7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Media' and 'model_Article'. From 'model_Media', the role 'model_Media' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Article', the role 'model_Article' has cardinality 0..*.
