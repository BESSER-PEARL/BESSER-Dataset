Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SensorPort' defines the following possible values: 'S2', 'S1', 'S4', 'S3'.
The enumeration 'MotorType' defines the following possible values: 'MEDIUM', 'LARGE'.
The enumeration 'SensorType' defines a single possible value: 'COLOR'.
The enumeration 'ComparisonOperator' defines the following possible values: 'LESS_OR_EQUAL', 'LESS', 'EQUAL', 'UNEQUAL', 'GREATER', 'GREATER_OR_EQUAL'.
The enumeration 'SensorMode' defines the following possible values: 'RED', 'COLOR_ID', 'AMBIENT'.
The enumeration 'MotorPort' defines the following possible values: 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B'.
The enumeration 'Direction' defines the following possible values: 'LEFT', 'BACKWARD', 'FORWARD', 'RIGHT'.
The enumeration 'ExprOperation' defines the following possible values: 'DIVIDE', 'MULTIPLY', 'PLUS', 'MINUS'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'robo_command_Drive' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'robo_command_Loop' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'robo_command_Branch' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'robo_command_Assignment' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'robo_expression_Variable' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'robo_expression_Operation' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'robo_expression_Literal' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'robo_condition_Comparison' is a specialization of 'Condition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
