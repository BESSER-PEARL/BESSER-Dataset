'Decorator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trigger_Predicate' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trigger_Trigger' is a specialization of 'Decorator'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trigger_Predicate' and 'trigger_Trigger'. From 'trigger_Predicate', the role 'trigger_Predicate' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trigger_Trigger', the role 'trigger_Trigger' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trigger_Decorator' and 'trigger_Trigger'. From 'trigger_Decorator', the role 'trigger_Decorator' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trigger_Trigger', the role 'trigger_Trigger2' has cardinality 0..*.
