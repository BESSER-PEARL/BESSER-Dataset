The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'trace_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EStructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_OutputFile' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'outlet', which is of type str; 'fileName', which is of type str.

'trace_InputElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_OutputFile' and 'trace_Trace'. From 'trace_OutputFile', the role 'trace_OutputFile' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_OutputFile' and 'trace_InputElement'. From 'trace_OutputFile', the role 'trace_OutputFile2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_InputElement', the role 'trace_InputElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_OutputFile' and 'trace_EObject'. From 'trace_OutputFile', the role 'trace_OutputFile4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_EObject' and 'trace_InputElement'. From 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_InputElement', the role 'trace_InputElement6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_InputElement' and 'trace_EStructuralFeature'. From 'trace_InputElement', the role 'trace_InputElement9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_EStructuralFeature', the role 'trace_EStructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
