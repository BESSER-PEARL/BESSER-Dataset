The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petrinet_TransitionPlaceArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc', the role 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc', the role 'petrinet_PlaceTransitionArc2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
