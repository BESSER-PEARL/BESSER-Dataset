The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'graph_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ElementType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_EdgeType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_NodeType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_ElementType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graph_Node' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'graph_Edge' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'graph_EdgeType' is a specialization of 'ElementType'.
The class 'graph_NodeType' is a specialization of 'ElementType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'Edge2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_NodeType' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_NodeType', the role 'graph_NodeType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'Node6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_EdgeType' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_EdgeType', the role 'graph_EdgeType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Element'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Element', the role 'element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_ElementType' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_ElementType', the role 'elementType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'Graph10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Element'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Element', the role 'Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_ElementType' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_ElementType', the role 'ElementType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph13' has cardinality 0..*.
