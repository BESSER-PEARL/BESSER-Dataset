The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'trace_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_M2MTraceItem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_TraceList' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_TraceItem' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'trace_TraceBySource' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_M2CTraceItem' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'targetFile', which is of type str; 'token', which is of type str.

'TraceItem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trace_M2MTraceItem' is a specialization of 'TraceItem'.
The class 'trace_M2CTraceItem' is a specialization of 'TraceItem'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_Trace' and 'trace_TraceList'. From 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_TraceList', the role 'trace_TraceList' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_TraceBySource' and 'trace_Trace'. From 'trace_TraceBySource', the role 'trace_TraceBySource' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_Trace', the role 'trace_Trace2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_TraceItem' and 'trace_TraceList'. From 'trace_TraceItem', the role 'trace_TraceItem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_TraceList', the role 'trace_TraceList4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_TraceItem' and 'trace_EObject'. From 'trace_TraceItem', the role 'trace_TraceItem6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_EObject' and 'trace_TraceBySource'. From 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_TraceBySource', the role 'trace_TraceBySource8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_TraceItem' and 'trace_TraceBySource'. From 'trace_TraceItem', the role 'trace_TraceItem12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_TraceBySource', the role 'trace_TraceBySource11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trace_EObject' and 'trace_M2MTraceItem'. From 'trace_EObject', the role 'trace_EObject14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_M2MTraceItem', the role 'trace_M2MTraceItem' has cardinality 0..*.
