The domain model 'sample' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'sample_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'sample_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sample_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'quantity', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str; 'valid', which is of type bool.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sample_B' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sample_B' and 'sample_C'. From 'sample_B', the role 'sample_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sample_C', the role 'sample_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sample_C' and 'sample_A'. From 'sample_C', the role 'sample_C2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sample_A', the role 'sample_A' has cardinality 0..*.
