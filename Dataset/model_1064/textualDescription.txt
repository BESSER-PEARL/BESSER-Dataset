It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Petrinet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'weight', which is of type int.

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_TPArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Arc' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Petrinet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petrinet_PTArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petrinet_TPArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
