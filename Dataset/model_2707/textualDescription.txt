The domain model 'tbase' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tbase_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tbase_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tbase_TRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tbase_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tbase_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tbase_A' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'tbase_B' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tbase_B' and 'tbase_A'. From 'tbase_B', the role 'tbase_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tbase_A', the role 'tbase_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tbase_C' and 'tbase_B'. From 'tbase_C', the role 'tbase_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tbase_B', the role 'tbase_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tbase_TRoot' and 'tbase_A'. From 'tbase_TRoot', the role 'tbase_TRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tbase_A', the role 'tbase_A4' has cardinality 0..*.
