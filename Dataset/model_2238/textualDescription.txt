Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DayOfWeek' defines the following possible values: 'Wednesday', 'Tuesday', 'Thursday', 'Monday', 'Friday'.
The enumeration 'TypeOfInstruction' defines the following possible values: 'Lecture', 'Lab'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'course_Student' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'course_CourseCoordinator' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'course_Lecturer' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'course_TA' is a specialization of 'Person'.
