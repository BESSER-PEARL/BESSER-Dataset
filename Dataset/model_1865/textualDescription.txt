Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'NewEnum1' defines the following possible values: 'LITERAL0', 'LITERAL1', 'LITERAL2'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statesml_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_State' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statesml_TerminalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statesml_SelectionDivergence' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_SelectionConvergence' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'statesml_RegularState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'statesml_ChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'statesml_Attribute' is a specialization of 'KeyValuePair'.
The class 'statesml_Parameter' is a specialization of 'KeyValuePair'.
