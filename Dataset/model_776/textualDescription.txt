Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_Association' and 'UML2WithID_Property'. From 'UML2WithID_Association', the role 'UML2WithID_Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_Property', the role 'UML2WithID_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_Classifier' and 'UML2WithID_Generalization'. From 'UML2WithID_Classifier', the role 'UML2WithID_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_Generalization', the role 'UML2WithID_Generalization' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_Classifier' and 'UML2WithID_Generalization'. From 'UML2WithID_Classifier', the role 'UML2WithID_Classifier4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_Generalization', the role 'UML2WithID_Generalization3' has cardinality 0..*.
