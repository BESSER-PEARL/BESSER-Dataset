The domain model 'simpleal' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'simpleal_ArithMinus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleal_Block' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Arith' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleal_Assign' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simpleal_Print' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simpleal_ArithPlus' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simpleal_VarRef' is a specialization of 'Arith'.
The class 'simpleal_ArithLit' is a specialization of 'Arith'.
The class 'simpleal_ArithOp' is a specialization of 'Arith'.
The class 'simpleal_ArithPlus' is a specialization of 'ArithOp'.
The class 'simpleal_ArithMinus' is a specialization of 'ArithOp'.
The class 'simpleal_Print' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.
The class 'simpleal_Assign' is a specialization of 'Stmt'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpleal_Block' and 'simpleal_Stmt'. From 'simpleal_Block', the role 'simpleal_Block' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleal_Stmt', the role 'simpleal_Stmt' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleal_Arith' and 'simpleal_ArithOp'. From 'simpleal_Arith', the role 'simpleal_Arith' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleal_ArithOp', the role 'simpleal_ArithOp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleal_ArithOp' and 'simpleal_Arith'. From 'simpleal_ArithOp', the role 'simpleal_ArithOp3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleal_Arith', the role 'simpleal_Arith4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleal_Assign' and 'simpleal_Arith'. From 'simpleal_Assign', the role 'simpleal_Assign' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleal_Arith', the role 'simpleal_Arith6' has cardinality 0..*.
