The class 'petrinet_OutArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_InArc' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_InArc', the role 'petrinet_InArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Transition' and 'petrinet_OutArc'. From 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_OutArc', the role 'petrinet_OutArc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_InArc' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_InArc', the role 'petrinet_InArc8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place9' has cardinality 0..*.
