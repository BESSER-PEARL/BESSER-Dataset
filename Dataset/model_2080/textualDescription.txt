The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sgf_tree_Root' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'sgf_tree_Coordinator' is a specialization of 'BasicNode'.
The class 'sgf_tree_Simulator' is a specialization of 'BasicNode'.
The class 'sgf_tree_BasicNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
