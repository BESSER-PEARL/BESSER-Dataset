The domain model 'fm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'fm_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'resourceAttribute', which is of type bool; 'weight', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'minimize', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str; 'qualityAttribute', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str; 'maxRangeValue', which is of type str; 'defaultValue', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'minRangeValue', which is of type str; 'objectiveFunctionAggregator', which is of type str.

'fm_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'upper', which is of type int; 'lower', which is of type int; 'optional', which is of type bool; 'cloneable', which is of type bool; 'description', which is of type str; 'orphan', which is of type bool; 'root', which is of type bool; 'id', which is of type str; 'mandatory', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'fm_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fm_FeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'comment', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'version', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str.

'fm_Group' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'or', which is of type bool; 'xor', which is of type bool; 'comment', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'upper', which is of type int; 'lower', which is of type int.

'fm_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description', which is of type str; 'language', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'BOOLEAN', 'STRING', 'DOUBLE', 'INTEGER'.
The enumeration 'ObjectiveFunctionType' defines the following possible values: 'PRODUCT', 'MINIMUM', 'NOT_ASSIGNED', 'SUM', 'MAXIMUM'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fm_FeatureModel' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_FeatureModel', the role 'fm_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_FeatureModel' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_FeatureModel', the role 'fm_FeatureModel2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_FeatureModel' and 'fm_Constraint'. From 'fm_FeatureModel', the role 'fm_FeatureModel5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Constraint', the role 'fm_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_EObject' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_EObject', the role 'fm_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'fm_Feature7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_Feature' and 'fm_Feature'. From 'fm_Feature', the role 'Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Feature', the role 'features' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fm_Feature' and 'fm_Group'. From 'fm_Feature', the role 'features11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fm_Group', the role 'Group' has cardinality 0..*.
