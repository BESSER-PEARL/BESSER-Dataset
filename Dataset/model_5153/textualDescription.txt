The domain model 'example' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'example_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'example_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
