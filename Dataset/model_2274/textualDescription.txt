Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'education_School' and 'education_Student'. From 'education_School', the role 'education_School' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'education_Student', the role 'education_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'education_School' and 'education_Course'. From 'education_School', the role 'education_School2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'education_Course', the role 'education_Course' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'education_Student' and 'education_School'. From 'education_Student', the role 'education_Student4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'education_School', the role 'education_School5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'education_Course' and 'education_Student'. From 'education_Course', the role 'education_Course8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'education_Student', the role 'education_Student7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'education_Course' and 'education_Student'. From 'education_Course', the role 'education_Course10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'education_Student', the role 'education_Student11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'education_Course' and 'education_School'. From 'education_Course', the role 'education_Course13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'education_School', the role 'education_School14' has cardinality 0..*.
