An association connects 'school_SchoolStatistics' and 'school_School'. From 'school_SchoolStatistics', the role 'school_SchoolStatistics' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_School', the role 'school_School2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Person' and 'school_School'. From 'school_Person', the role 'school_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_School', the role 'school_School4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Teacher' and 'school_Student'. From 'school_Teacher', the role 'school_Teacher' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
