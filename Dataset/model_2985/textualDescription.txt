'zhu_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'zhu_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'zhu_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'zhu_TriggersSeparated' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'firstTrigger', which is of type str; 'followingTriggers', which is of type str.

'zhu_States' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'zhu_StateMachine' and 'zhu_TopRegion'. From 'zhu_StateMachine', the role 'zhu_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'zhu_TopRegion', the role 'zhu_TopRegion' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'zhu_States' and 'zhu_TopRegion'. From 'zhu_States', the role 'zhu_States' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'zhu_TopRegion', the role 'zhu_TopRegion2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'zhu_Region' and 'zhu_TopRegion'. From 'zhu_Region', the role 'zhu_Region' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'zhu_TopRegion', the role 'zhu_TopRegion4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'zhu_TopRegion' and 'zhu_Transitions'. From 'zhu_TopRegion', the role 'zhu_TopRegion6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'zhu_Transitions', the role 'zhu_Transitions' has cardinality 0..*.
