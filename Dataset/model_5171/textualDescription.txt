The domain model 'binDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'binDsl_L' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'binDsl_N' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'cond', which is of type bool.

'binDsl_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'b', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'binDsl_N' and 'binDsl_L'. From 'binDsl_N', the role 'binDsl_N' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'binDsl_L', the role 'binDsl_L' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'binDsl_L' and 'binDsl_N'. From 'binDsl_L', the role 'binDsl_L3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'binDsl_N', the role 'binDsl_N2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'binDsl_L' and 'binDsl_B'. From 'binDsl_L', the role 'binDsl_L5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'binDsl_B', the role 'binDsl_B' has cardinality 0..*.
