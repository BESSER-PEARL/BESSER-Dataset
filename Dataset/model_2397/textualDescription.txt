The domain model 'sQL' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'sQL_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sQL_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'sQL_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'dataType', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'notNull', which is of type str.

'sQL_PrimaryKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sQL_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sQL_Database' and 'sQL_Table'. From 'sQL_Database', the role 'sQL_Database' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_Table', the role 'sQL_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_Column' and 'sQL_Table'. From 'sQL_Column', the role 'sQL_Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_Table', the role 'sQL_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_PrimaryKey' and 'sQL_Table'. From 'sQL_PrimaryKey', the role 'sQL_PrimaryKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_Table', the role 'sQL_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_ForeignKey' and 'sQL_Table'. From 'sQL_ForeignKey', the role 'sQL_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_Table', the role 'sQL_Table6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_PrimaryKey' and 'sQL_Column'. From 'sQL_PrimaryKey', the role 'sQL_PrimaryKey8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_Column', the role 'sQL_Column9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_Column' and 'sQL_ForeignKey'. From 'sQL_Column', the role 'sQL_Column12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_ForeignKey', the role 'sQL_ForeignKey11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_Table' and 'sQL_ForeignKey'. From 'sQL_Table', the role 'sQL_Table15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_ForeignKey', the role 'sQL_ForeignKey14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sQL_Column' and 'sQL_ForeignKey'. From 'sQL_Column', the role 'sQL_Column18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sQL_ForeignKey', the role 'sQL_ForeignKey17' has cardinality 0..*.
