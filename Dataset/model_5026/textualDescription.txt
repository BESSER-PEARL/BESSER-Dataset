The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'company_Company' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'company_Supplier' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'company_Customer' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'company_PurchaseOrder' is a specialization of 'Order'.
The class 'company_SalesOrder' is a specialization of 'Order'.
