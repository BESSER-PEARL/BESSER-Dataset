The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'brmodel_RelatedMethod' is a specialization of 'Method'.
The class 'brmodel_Statement' is a specialization of 'Trace'.
The class 'brmodel_SlicedVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'brmodel_RelatedVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'brmodel_ReachableVariable' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'brmodel_Variable' is a specialization of 'Trace'.
The class 'brmodel_Method' is a specialization of 'Trace'.
The class 'brmodel_ReachableMethod' is a specialization of 'Method'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'brmodel_Rule' and 'brmodel_Model'. From 'brmodel_Rule', the role 'brmodel_Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'brmodel_Model', the role 'brmodel_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'brmodel_Rule' and 'brmodel_SlicedVariable'. From 'brmodel_Rule', the role 'brmodel_Rule2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'brmodel_SlicedVariable', the role 'brmodel_SlicedVariable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'brmodel_Rule' and 'brmodel_RulePart'. From 'brmodel_Rule', the role 'brmodel_Rule4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'brmodel_RulePart', the role 'brmodel_RulePart' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'brmodel_RulePart' and 'brmodel_RelatedMethod'. From 'brmodel_RulePart', the role 'brmodel_RulePart6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'brmodel_RelatedMethod', the role 'brmodel_RelatedMethod' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'brmodel_RulePart' and 'brmodel_Statement'. From 'brmodel_RulePart', the role 'brmodel_RulePart8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'brmodel_Statement', the role 'brmodel_Statement' has cardinality 0..*.
