Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ForLoopDirection' defines the following possible values: 'UP', 'DOWN'.
The enumeration 'ComparisonOperator' defines the following possible values: 'LESS_THAN_EQUAL', 'GREATER_THAN', 'EQUAL', 'GREATER_THAN_EQUAL', 'LESS_THAN', 'INEQUAL'.
