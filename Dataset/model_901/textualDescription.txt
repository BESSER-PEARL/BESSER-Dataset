The domain model 'iritpdl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'iritpdl_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'minTime', which is of type int; 'maxTime', which is of type int.

'iritpdl_WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'maxTime', which is of type int; 'minTime', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'iritpdl_ResourceConf' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'iritpdl_ResourceType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'occurrences', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'iritpdl_Resource' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'occurrences', which is of type int.

'iritpdl_ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iritpdl_Guidance' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iritpdl_WorkSequence' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'linkType', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'WorkSequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'startToFinish', 'finishToStart', 'finishToFinish', 'startToStart'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'iritpdl_WorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'iritpdl_WorkSequence' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'iritpdl_ProcessElement' and 'iritpdl_Process'. From 'iritpdl_ProcessElement', the role 'iritpdl_ProcessElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iritpdl_Process', the role 'iritpdl_Process' has cardinality 0..*.
