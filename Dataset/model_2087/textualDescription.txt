The domain model 'tree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'tree_Tree' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tree_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'anAttribute3', which is of type int; 'anAttribute', which is of type int; 'anAttribute2', which is of type int; 'anAttribute4', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tree_Tree' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Tree', the role 'tree_Tree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'child' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'Node5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node8' has cardinality 0..*.
