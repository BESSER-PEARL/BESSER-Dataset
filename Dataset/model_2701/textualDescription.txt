The domain model 'ktest206' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'ktest206_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ktest206_N' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ktest206_V' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ktest206_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ktest206_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'B' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ktest206_B' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'ktest206_A' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'ktest206_X' is a specialization of 'Y'.
The class 'ktest206_Y' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'ktest206_E' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'ktest206_W' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'ktest206_V' is a specialization of 'Y'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ktest206_C' and 'ktest206_B'. From 'ktest206_C', the role 'ktest206_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest206_B', the role 'ktest206_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest206_A' and 'ktest206_D'. From 'ktest206_A', the role 'ktest206_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest206_D', the role 'ktest206_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest206_W' and 'ktest206_X'. From 'ktest206_W', the role 'ktest206_W' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest206_X', the role 'ktest206_X' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest206_E' and 'ktest206_Y'. From 'ktest206_E', the role 'ktest206_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest206_Y', the role 'ktest206_Y' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ktest206_V' and 'ktest206_W'. From 'ktest206_V', the role 'ktest206_V' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ktest206_W', the role 'ktest206_W5' has cardinality 0..*.
