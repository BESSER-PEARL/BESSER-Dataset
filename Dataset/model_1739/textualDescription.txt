The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'model_Book' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'data', which is of type str; 'title', which is of type str; 'tags', which is of type str.

'model_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'model_MappedLibrary' represents an important domain concept.

It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Location' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'address', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_Book' and 'model_Person'. From 'model_Book', the role 'Book' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Person', the role 'authors' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Book' and 'model_Person'. From 'model_Book', the role 'books' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Person', the role 'Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Book' and 'model_Library'. From 'model_Book', the role 'model_Book' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Library', the role 'model_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Library' and 'model_Location'. From 'model_Library', the role 'model_Library4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Location', the role 'model_Location' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Library' and 'model_Book'. From 'model_Library', the role 'model_Library6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Book', the role 'model_Book7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Location' and 'model_Book'. From 'model_Location', the role 'model_Location9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Book', the role 'model_Book10' has cardinality 0..*.
