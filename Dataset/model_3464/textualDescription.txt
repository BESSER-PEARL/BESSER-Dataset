The domain model 'featureModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'featureModel_ExcludeConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Group' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nameB', which is of type str; 'nameA', which is of type str.

'featureModel_PropFormula' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Proposition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nameA', which is of type str; 'nameRest', which is of type str.

'featureModel_FeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_ImplyConstraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Group' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Constraints' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featureModel_Feature' is a specialization of 'Group'.
The class 'featureModel_ImplyConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.
The class 'featureModel_ExcludeConstraint' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'featureModel_Feature' and 'featureModel_FeatureModel'. From 'featureModel_Feature', the role 'featureModel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'featureModel_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_Constraints' and 'featureModel_FeatureModel'. From 'featureModel_Constraints', the role 'featureModel_Constraints' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'featureModel_FeatureModel2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_PropFormula' and 'featureModel_FeatureModel'. From 'featureModel_PropFormula', the role 'featureModel_PropFormula' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_FeatureModel', the role 'featureModel_FeatureModel4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_Feature' and 'featureModel_Group'. From 'featureModel_Feature', the role 'featureModel_Feature6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Group', the role 'featureModel_Group' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_Constraints' and 'featureModel_Constraint'. From 'featureModel_Constraints', the role 'featureModel_Constraints8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Constraint', the role 'featureModel_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_PropFormula' and 'featureModel_Proposition'. From 'featureModel_PropFormula', the role 'featureModel_PropFormula10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Proposition', the role 'featureModel_Proposition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_Proposition' and 'featureModel_PropFormula'. From 'featureModel_Proposition', the role 'featureModel_Proposition13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_PropFormula', the role 'featureModel_PropFormula12' has cardinality 0..*.
