The domain model 'petri' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petri_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tokens', which is of type int.

'petri_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petri_Place' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petri_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petri_PetriNet' and 'petri_NamedElement'. From 'petri_PetriNet', the role 'petri_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_NamedElement', the role 'petri_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_Place' and 'petri_Transition'. From 'petri_Place', the role 'petri_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_Transition', the role 'petri_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_Place' and 'petri_Transition'. From 'petri_Place', the role 'petri_Place4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_Transition', the role 'petri_Transition3' has cardinality 0..*.
