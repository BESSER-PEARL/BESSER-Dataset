An association connects 'university_Staff' and 'university_Professor'. From 'university_Staff', the role 'university_Staff' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Professor', the role 'university_Professor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Staff' and 'university_Assistant'. From 'university_Staff', the role 'university_Staff3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Assistant', the role 'university_Assistant' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Address' and 'university_Person'. From 'university_Address', the role 'university_Address' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Person', the role 'university_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
