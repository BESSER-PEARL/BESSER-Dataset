The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_StateFinal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_StateOn' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_StateOff' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_StateOn' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_StateOff' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_StateFinal' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
