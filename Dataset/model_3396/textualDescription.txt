Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ramRoot_GenericNode' and 'ramRoot_MT__Element'. From 'ramRoot_GenericNode', the role 'ramRoot_GenericNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MT__Element', the role 'ramRoot_MT__Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpos__Chair' and 'ramRoot_MTpos__Table'. From 'ramRoot_MTpos__Chair', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Chair' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpos__Table', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpos__Table' and 'ramRoot_MTpos__Waitress'. From 'ramRoot_MTpos__Table', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Table3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpos__Waitress', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Waitress' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpre__Table' and 'ramRoot_MTpre__Chair'. From 'ramRoot_MTpre__Table', the role 'ramRoot_MTpre__Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpre__Chair', the role 'ramRoot_MTpre__Chair' has cardinality 0..*.
