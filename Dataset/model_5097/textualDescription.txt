The class 'testport_Base' is a specialization of 'Component'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testport_Required' and 'testport_Component'. From 'testport_Required', the role 'testport_Required' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testport_Component', the role 'testport_Component' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testport_Base' and 'testport_Base'. From 'testport_Base', the role 'testport_Base' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testport_Base', the role 'testport_Base1' has cardinality 0..*.
