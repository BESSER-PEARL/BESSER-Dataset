The domain model 'finalStateMachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'finalStateMachine_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'finalStateMachine_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'finalStateMachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'finalStateMachine_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'finalStateMachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'finalStateMachine_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'finalStateMachine_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'finalStateMachine_FSM' and 'finalStateMachine_Transition'. From 'finalStateMachine_FSM', the role 'finalStateMachine_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'finalStateMachine_Transition', the role 'finalStateMachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'finalStateMachine_State' and 'finalStateMachine_FSM'. From 'finalStateMachine_State', the role 'finalStateMachine_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'finalStateMachine_FSM', the role 'finalStateMachine_FSM2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'finalStateMachine_State' and 'finalStateMachine_Transition'. From 'finalStateMachine_State', the role 'finalStateMachine_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'finalStateMachine_Transition', the role 'finalStateMachine_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'finalStateMachine_Transition' and 'finalStateMachine_State'. From 'finalStateMachine_Transition', the role 'finalStateMachine_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'finalStateMachine_State', the role 'finalStateMachine_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
