The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ioT_Method' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'ioT_OrCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'ioT_AndCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'ioT_ComparisonCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'ioT_LiteralBool' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'ioT_LiteralNumber' is a specialization of 'Condition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
