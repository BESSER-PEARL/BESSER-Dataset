'dc_Point' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'y', which is of type str; 'x', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'KnownColor' defines the following possible values: 'gray', 'lime', 'fuchsia', 'green', 'yellow', 'black', 'blue', 'teal', 'maroon', 'white', 'red', 'orange', 'purple', 'navy', 'silver', 'aqua', 'olive'.
