Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'LaunchType' defines the following possible values: 'VTOL', 'HTOL', 'OTHER'.
The enumeration 'MemoryType' defines the following possible values: 'VOLATILE', 'STORAGE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'drone_Drone' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_Processor' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_Memory' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_Battery' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_Device' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_Action' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_Property' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'drone_ROSDriver' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'drone_Size' and 'drone_Drone'. From 'drone_Size', the role 'drone_Size' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drone_Drone', the role 'drone_Drone' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drone_FlightPerformance' and 'drone_Drone'. From 'drone_FlightPerformance', the role 'drone_FlightPerformance' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drone_Drone', the role 'drone_Drone2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drone_Drone' and 'drone_Battery'. From 'drone_Drone', the role 'drone_Drone4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drone_Battery', the role 'drone_Battery' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drone_Processor' and 'drone_Drone'. From 'drone_Processor', the role 'drone_Processor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drone_Drone', the role 'drone_Drone6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'drone_Memory' and 'drone_Drone'. From 'drone_Memory', the role 'drone_Memory' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'drone_Drone', the role 'drone_Drone8' has cardinality 0..*.
