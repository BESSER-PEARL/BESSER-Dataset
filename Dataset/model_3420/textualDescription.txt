Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tracker_AnimalId' and 'tracker_Animal'. From 'tracker_AnimalId', the role 'tracker_AnimalId' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Animal', the role 'tracker_Animal' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_AnimalId' and 'tracker_Event'. From 'tracker_AnimalId', the role 'tracker_AnimalId2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Event', the role 'tracker_Event' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_Premises' and 'tracker_Animals'. From 'tracker_Premises', the role 'tracker_Premises' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Animals', the role 'tracker_Animals' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_Premises' and 'tracker_EventHistory'. From 'tracker_Premises', the role 'tracker_Premises5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_EventHistory', the role 'tracker_EventHistory' has cardinality 0..*.
