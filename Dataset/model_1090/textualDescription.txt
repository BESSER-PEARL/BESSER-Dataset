The model defines 3 main class(es).

'PetriNet_Net' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Net' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_Net', the role 'Net' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'dst' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Transition' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'Transition3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'src' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Transition' and 'PetriNet_Net'. From 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Net', the role 'Net5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'dst7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'Place10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'src9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Net'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'Place12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Net', the role 'net' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Transition' and 'PetriNet_Net'. From 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'Transition15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Net', the role 'net14' has cardinality 0..*.
