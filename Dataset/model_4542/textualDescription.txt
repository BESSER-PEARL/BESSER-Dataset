Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'units_Quantity' and 'units_Unit'. From 'units_Quantity', the role 'units_Quantity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_Unit', the role 'units_Unit' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_Quantity' and 'units_QuantityHomogenousOperation'. From 'units_Quantity', the role 'units_Quantity2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_QuantityHomogenousOperation', the role 'units_QuantityHomogenousOperation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_Quantity' and 'units_QuantityHomogenousOperation'. From 'units_Quantity', the role 'units_Quantity5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_QuantityHomogenousOperation', the role 'units_QuantityHomogenousOperation4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'units_QuantityScalarOperation' and 'units_Quantity'. From 'units_QuantityScalarOperation', the role 'units_QuantityScalarOperation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'units_Quantity', the role 'units_Quantity7' has cardinality 0..*.
