The domain model 'mealymodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'mealymodel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'output', which is of type str; 'input', which is of type str.

'mealymodel_Alphabet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'characters', which is of type str.

'mealymodel_MealyMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mealymodel_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mealymodel_State' and 'mealymodel_MealyMachine'. From 'mealymodel_State', the role 'mealymodel_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mealymodel_MealyMachine', the role 'mealymodel_MealyMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mealymodel_State' and 'mealymodel_MealyMachine'. From 'mealymodel_State', the role 'mealymodel_State3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mealymodel_MealyMachine', the role 'mealymodel_MealyMachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mealymodel_Alphabet' and 'mealymodel_MealyMachine'. From 'mealymodel_Alphabet', the role 'mealymodel_Alphabet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mealymodel_MealyMachine', the role 'mealymodel_MealyMachine5' has cardinality 0..*.
