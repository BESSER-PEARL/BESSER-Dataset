The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'graph_Dependency' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'locality', which is of type str.

'graph_Cause' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'version', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'containerName', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str; 'unitVersion', which is of type str; 'nodeName', which is of type str; 'unitName', which is of type str.

'graph_DocumentRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'mixed', which is of type str.

'graph_EnvironmentGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Dependency' and 'graph_Cause'. From 'graph_Dependency', the role 'graph_Dependency' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Cause', the role 'graph_Cause' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Dependency' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Dependency', the role 'graph_Dependency2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Dependency'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Dependency', the role 'graph_Dependency4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_DocumentRoot' and 'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry'. From 'graph_DocumentRoot', the role 'graph_DocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'graph_DocumentRoot'. From 'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'graph_EStringToStringMapEntry9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_DocumentRoot', the role 'graph_DocumentRoot8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_DocumentRoot' and 'graph_Cause'. From 'graph_DocumentRoot', the role 'graph_DocumentRoot11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Cause', the role 'graph_Cause12' has cardinality 0..*.
