Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'startToFinish', 'finishToFinish', 'startToStart', 'finishToStart'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'publication_PlaceHolderRule' is a specialization of 'PlaceHolder'.
The class 'publication_PlaceHolderRn' is a specialization of 'PlaceHolder'.
The class 'publication_PlaceHolderPP' is a specialization of 'PlaceHolder'.
