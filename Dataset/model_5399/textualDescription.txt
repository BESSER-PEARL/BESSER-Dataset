The domain model 'architectureTool' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'architectureTool_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classMember' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'architectureTool_Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'architectureTool_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'Visable', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'architectureTool_Port' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'required', which is of type str; 'simple', which is of type str; 'provided', which is of type str.

'architectureTool_Method' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'returnType', which is of type str; 'parameter', which is of type str; 'visable', which is of type str.

'architectureTool_classMember' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'architectureTool_System' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'architectureTool_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'architectureTool_Class' is a specialization of 'classMember'.
The class 'architectureTool_Interface' is a specialization of 'classMember'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
