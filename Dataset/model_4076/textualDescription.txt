The domain model 'SimpleUML' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'SimpleUML_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleUML_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isMultivalued', which is of type bool.

'SimpleUML_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SimpleUML_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'SimpleUML_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_Class' and 'SimpleUML_Package'. From 'SimpleUML_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_Package', the role 'pkg' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_Feature' and 'SimpleUML_Class'. From 'SimpleUML_Feature', the role 'SimpleUML_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_Class', the role 'SimpleUML_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_Package' and 'SimpleUML_Class'. From 'SimpleUML_Package', the role 'Package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_Class', the role 'classes' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleUML_Class' and 'SimpleUML_Feature'. From 'SimpleUML_Class', the role 'SimpleUML_Class5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleUML_Feature', the role 'SimpleUML_Feature4' has cardinality 0..*.
