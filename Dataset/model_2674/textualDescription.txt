The domain model 'refs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'refs_H' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refs_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refs_Named' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'refs_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refs_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refs_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refs_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refs_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'refs_A' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refs_B' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refs_C' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refs_E' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refs_F' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refs_G' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refs_H' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'refs_A' and 'refs_B'. From 'refs_A', the role 'refs_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_B', the role 'refs_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_E' and 'refs_A'. From 'refs_E', the role 'refs_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_A', the role 'refs_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_A' and 'refs_C'. From 'refs_A', the role 'refs_A4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_C', the role 'refs_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_G' and 'refs_A'. From 'refs_G', the role 'refs_G' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_A', the role 'refs_A6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_A' and 'refs_H'. From 'refs_A', the role 'refs_A8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_H', the role 'refs_H' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_B' and 'refs_C'. From 'refs_B', the role 'refs_B10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_C', the role 'refs_C11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_B' and 'refs_G'. From 'refs_B', the role 'refs_B13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_G', the role 'refs_G14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_F' and 'refs_E'. From 'refs_F', the role 'refs_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_E', the role 'refs_E16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refs_H' and 'refs_G'. From 'refs_H', the role 'refs_H19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refs_G', the role 'refs_G18' has cardinality 0..*.
