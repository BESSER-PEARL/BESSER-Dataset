The domain model 'GraphOperations' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'GraphOperations_Triangle' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphOperations_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphOperations_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'state', which is of type str; 'weight', which is of type float.

'GraphOperations_EIntContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'GraphOperations_ConstantUtils' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'GraphOperations_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'depth', which is of type int; 'degree', which is of type float.

'GraphOperations_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EdgeState' defines the following possible values: 'ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'GraphOperations_Node' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'GraphOperations_Edge' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Node' and 'GraphOperations_Graph'. From 'GraphOperations_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Graph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Edge' and 'GraphOperations_Graph'. From 'GraphOperations_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Graph', the role 'graph2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Node' and 'GraphOperations_Graph'. From 'GraphOperations_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Edge' and 'GraphOperations_Node'. From 'GraphOperations_Edge', the role 'Edge5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Node' and 'GraphOperations_Edge'. From 'GraphOperations_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Edge', the role 'Edge7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Graph' and 'GraphOperations_Edge'. From 'GraphOperations_Graph', the role 'Graph9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Edge', the role 'edges' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'GraphOperations_Edge' and 'GraphOperations_Node'. From 'GraphOperations_Edge', the role 'outgoingEdges' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'GraphOperations_Node', the role 'Node11' has cardinality 0..*.
