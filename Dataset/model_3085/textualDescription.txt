Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ObjectNodeKind' defines the following possible values: 'Unspecified', 'NoBuffer', 'Overwrite'.
The enumeration 'ObjectNodeOrderingKind' defines the following possible values: 'LIFO', 'FIFO', 'unordered', 'ordered'.

The class 'activity_ObjectFlow' is a specialization of 'ActivityEdge'.
The class 'activity_ActivityPartition' is a specialization of 'AbstractNamedElement'.
The class 'activity_ActivityPartition' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'activity_ActivityNode' is a specialization of 'AbstractNamedElement'.
The class 'activity_AbstractAction' is a specialization of 'AbstractNamedElement'.
The class 'activity_AbstractAction' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'activity_AcceptEventAction' is a specialization of 'AbstractAction'.
The class 'activity_ObjectNode' is a specialization of 'ActivityNode'.
The class 'activity_ObjectNode' is a specialization of 'AbstractNamedElement'.
The class 'activity_Pin' is a specialization of 'ObjectNode'.
The class 'activity_InputPin' is a specialization of 'Pin'.
The class 'activity_OutputPin' is a specialization of 'Pin'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'activity_ValueSpecification' and 'activity_ActivityEdge'. From 'activity_ValueSpecification', the role 'activity_ValueSpecification' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'activity_ActivityEdge', the role 'activity_ActivityEdge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'activity_ActivityEdge' and 'activity_ValueSpecification'. From 'activity_ActivityEdge', the role 'activity_ActivityEdge2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'activity_ValueSpecification', the role 'activity_ValueSpecification3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'activity_ActivityNode' and 'activity_ActivityEdge'. From 'activity_ActivityNode', the role 'activity_ActivityNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'activity_ActivityEdge', the role 'activity_ActivityEdge5' has cardinality 0..*.
