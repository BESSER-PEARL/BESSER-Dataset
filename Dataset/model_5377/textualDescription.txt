Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'types' defines the following possible values: 'button', 'number', 'text'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'html5_div' is a specialization of 'container'.
The class 'html5_table' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.
The class 'html5_img' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.
The class 'html5_label' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.
The class 'html5_input' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.
The class 'html5_button' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.
The class 'html5_fieldset' is a specialization of 'container'.
The class 'html5_dialog' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.
The class 'html5_select' is a specialization of 'htmlElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'html5_Action' and 'html5_div'. From 'html5_Action', the role 'html5_Action' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_div', the role 'html5_div' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_table' and 'html5_tr'. From 'html5_table', the role 'html5_table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_tr', the role 'html5_tr' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_td' and 'html5_tr'. From 'html5_td', the role 'html5_td' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_tr', the role 'html5_tr3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_htmlElement' and 'html5_td'. From 'html5_htmlElement', the role 'html5_htmlElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_td', the role 'html5_td5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_legend' and 'html5_fieldset'. From 'html5_legend', the role 'html5_legend' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_fieldset', the role 'html5_fieldset' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_container' and 'html5_html'. From 'html5_container', the role 'html5_container' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_html', the role 'html5_html' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_htmlElement' and 'html5_container'. From 'html5_htmlElement', the role 'html5_htmlElement10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_container', the role 'html5_container9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_container' and 'html5_container'. From 'html5_container', the role 'html5_container13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_container', the role 'html5_container11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'html5_select' and 'html5_option'. From 'html5_select', the role 'html5_select' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'html5_option', the role 'html5_option' has cardinality 0..*.
