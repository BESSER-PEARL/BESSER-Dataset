Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'docbook_ChapterType' and 'docbook_BookType'. From 'docbook_ChapterType', the role 'docbook_ChapterType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_BookType', the role 'docbook_BookType' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_Sect1Type' and 'docbook_ChapterType'. From 'docbook_Sect1Type', the role 'docbook_Sect1Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_ChapterType', the role 'docbook_ChapterType2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'docbook_DocumentRoot'. From 'docbook_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'docbook_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_DocumentRoot', the role 'docbook_DocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'docbook_DocumentRoot'. From 'docbook_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'docbook_EStringToStringMapEntry6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_DocumentRoot', the role 'docbook_DocumentRoot5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_BookType' and 'docbook_DocumentRoot'. From 'docbook_BookType', the role 'docbook_BookType9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_DocumentRoot', the role 'docbook_DocumentRoot8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_ChapterType' and 'docbook_DocumentRoot'. From 'docbook_ChapterType', the role 'docbook_ChapterType12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_DocumentRoot', the role 'docbook_DocumentRoot11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'docbook_Sect1Type' and 'docbook_DocumentRoot'. From 'docbook_Sect1Type', the role 'docbook_Sect1Type15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'docbook_DocumentRoot', the role 'docbook_DocumentRoot14' has cardinality 0..*.
