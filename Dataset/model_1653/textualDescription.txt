The domain model 'yyaa' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'yyaa_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyaa_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'yyaa_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'yyaa_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'yyaa_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'yyaa_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyaa_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'yyaa_Thing' and 'yyaa_World'. From 'yyaa_Thing', the role 'yyaa_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyaa_World', the role 'yyaa_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyaa_RelatedTo' and 'yyaa_Thing'. From 'yyaa_RelatedTo', the role '2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyaa_Thing', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyaa_Alias' and 'yyaa_NamedElement'. From 'yyaa_Alias', the role 'yyaa_Alias' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyaa_NamedElement', the role 'yyaa_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyaa_Thing' and 'yyaa_RelatedTo'. From 'yyaa_Thing', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyaa_RelatedTo', the role '5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyaa_RelatedTo' and 'yyaa_Thing'. From 'yyaa_RelatedTo', the role 'yyaa_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyaa_Thing', the role 'yyaa_Thing8' has cardinality 0..*.
