An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Writer'. From 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Writer', the role 'library_Writer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Book'. From 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Book', the role 'library_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
