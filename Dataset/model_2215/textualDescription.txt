The domain model 'university' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'university_ProgrammeSemesters' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_Semesters' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semesterTime', which is of type str; 'year', which is of type int.

'university_Slot' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'points', which is of type int; 'slotType', which is of type str.

'university_University' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'university_Programmes' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'university_Specializations' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'university_ProgrammeInstances' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'startYear', which is of type int.

'university_CourseInstances' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_Courses' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'credits', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SemesterTime' defines the following possible values: 'Fall', 'Spring'.
The enumeration 'SlotType' defines the following possible values: 'V', 'O', 'V2'.
