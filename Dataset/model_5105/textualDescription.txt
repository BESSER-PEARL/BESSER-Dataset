The domain model 'testPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'SecondClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testPackage_SecondSubClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FirstClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testPackage_FirstSubClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testPackage_SecondClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'testPackage_FirstClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'testPackage_FirstSubClass' is a specialization of 'FirstClass'.
The class 'testPackage_SecondSubClass' is a specialization of 'SecondClass'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testPackage_SecondClass' and 'testPackage_FirstClass'. From 'testPackage_SecondClass', the role 'testPackage_SecondClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testPackage_FirstClass', the role 'testPackage_FirstClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testPackage_SecondClass' and 'testPackage_FirstSubClass'. From 'testPackage_SecondClass', the role 'testPackage_SecondClass2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testPackage_FirstSubClass', the role 'testPackage_FirstSubClass' has cardinality 0..*.
