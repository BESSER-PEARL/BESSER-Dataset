The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'robot_Robot' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'robot_Scenario' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'robot_ObjectAheadCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'robot_TrueCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'robot_ConditionalStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'robot_ControlStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'robot_ExecuteStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'robot_ForwardStatement' is a specialization of 'ControlStatement'.
The class 'robot_IfStatement' is a specialization of 'ConditionalStatement'.
The class 'robot_PrintStatement' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'robot_RightStatement' is a specialization of 'ControlStatement'.
The class 'robot_UntilStatement' is a specialization of 'ConditionalStatement'.
The class 'robot_WhileStatement' is a specialization of 'ConditionalStatement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'robot_Scenario' and 'robot_Robot'. From 'robot_Scenario', the role 'robot_Scenario' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_Robot', the role 'robot_Robot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_StatementBlock' and 'robot_Robot'. From 'robot_StatementBlock', the role 'robot_StatementBlock' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_Robot', the role 'robot_Robot2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_Scenario' and 'robot_Robot'. From 'robot_Scenario', the role 'robot_Scenario5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_Robot', the role 'robot_Robot4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_Robot' and 'robot_Connection'. From 'robot_Robot', the role 'robot_Robot7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_Connection', the role 'robot_Connection' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_Scenario' and 'robot_StatementBlock'. From 'robot_Scenario', the role 'robot_Scenario9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_StatementBlock', the role 'robot_StatementBlock10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_ConditionalStatement' and 'robot_Condition'. From 'robot_ConditionalStatement', the role 'robot_ConditionalStatement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_Condition', the role 'robot_Condition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_ConditionalStatement' and 'robot_StatementBlock'. From 'robot_ConditionalStatement', the role 'robot_ConditionalStatement13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_StatementBlock', the role 'robot_StatementBlock14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_Scenario' and 'robot_ExecuteStatement'. From 'robot_Scenario', the role 'robot_Scenario16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_ExecuteStatement', the role 'robot_ExecuteStatement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'robot_Statement' and 'robot_StatementBlock'. From 'robot_Statement', the role 'robot_Statement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'robot_StatementBlock', the role 'robot_StatementBlock18' has cardinality 0..*.
