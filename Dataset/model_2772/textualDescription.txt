The domain model 'nestedgroup' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'nestedgroup_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'group', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'b', which is of type str.

'nestedgroup_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'true', which is of type str; 'mixed', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'nestedgroup_CType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'cvalue', which is of type str; 'cname', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'nestedgroup_CType' and 'nestedgroup_A'. From 'nestedgroup_CType', the role 'nestedgroup_CType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nestedgroup_A', the role 'nestedgroup_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nestedgroup_Element' and 'nestedgroup_CType'. From 'nestedgroup_Element', the role 'nestedgroup_Element' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nestedgroup_CType', the role 'nestedgroup_CType2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nestedgroup_Element' and 'nestedgroup_Element'. From 'nestedgroup_Element', the role 'nestedgroup_Element3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nestedgroup_Element', the role 'nestedgroup_Element5' has cardinality 0..*.
