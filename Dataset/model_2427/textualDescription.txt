The domain model 'database' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'database_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

'database_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'database_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

'database_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Name', which is of type str; 'Type', which is of type str; 'IsPrimaryKey', which is of type bool.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DataType' defines the following possible values: 'Int', 'Date', 'String', 'Float'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'database_Database' and 'database_ForeignKey'. From 'database_Database', the role 'DbFkRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_ForeignKey', the role 'ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Database' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_Database', the role 'DbTableRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_Database'. From 'database_Table', the role 'DbTable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Database', the role 'Database' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Column' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'ColumnTable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_Column'. From 'database_Table', the role 'Table5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Column', the role 'TableColumn' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_ForeignKey'. From 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_ForeignKey', the role 'database_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_ForeignKey'. From 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_ForeignKey', the role 'database_ForeignKey8' has cardinality 0..*.
