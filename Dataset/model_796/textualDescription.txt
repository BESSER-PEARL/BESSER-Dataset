The domain model 'compositefsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'compositefsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'compositefsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'compositefsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'input', which is of type str; 'output', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
