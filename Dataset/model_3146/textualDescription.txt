The domain model 'XPath' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'XPath_VariableExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'XPath_LiteralExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'XPath_LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'location', which is of type str; 'commentsBefore', which is of type str; 'commentsAfter', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'XPath_StringExp' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'symbol', which is of type str.

'XPath_IntegerExp' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'symbol', which is of type str.

'LiteralExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'XPath_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'XPath_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'XPath_OperatorCallExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'XPath_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'XPath_Expression' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'XPath_VariableExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'XPath_VariableExp' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'XPath_LiteralExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'XPath_IntegerExp' is a specialization of 'LiteralExp'.
The class 'XPath_StringExp' is a specialization of 'LiteralExp'.
The class 'XPath_OperatorCallExp' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'XPath_OperatorCallExp' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'XPath_Expression' and 'XPath_OperatorCallExp'. From 'XPath_Expression', the role 'XPath_Expression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'XPath_OperatorCallExp', the role 'XPath_OperatorCallExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'XPath_Expression' and 'XPath_OperatorCallExp'. From 'XPath_Expression', the role 'XPath_Expression3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'XPath_OperatorCallExp', the role 'XPath_OperatorCallExp2' has cardinality 0..*.
