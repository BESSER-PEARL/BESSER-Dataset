An association connects 'Abc_A' and 'Abc_C'. From 'Abc_A', the role 'Abc_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Abc_C', the role 'Abc_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Abc_C' and 'Abc_classB'. From 'Abc_C', the role 'Abc_C4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Abc_classB', the role 'Abc_classB5' has cardinality 0..*.
