The domain model 'dslComponent' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 16 main class(es).

'dslComponent_Port' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'dslComponent_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dslComponent_WTComponents' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'author', which is of type str.

It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dslComponent_Vertex' is a specialization of 'DocumElt'.
The class 'dslComponent_Edge' is a specialization of 'DocumElt'.
The class 'dslComponent_SimpleState' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'dslComponent_InitialState' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'dslComponent_InPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'dslComponent_OutPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
