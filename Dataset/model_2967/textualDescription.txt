Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EEnumValueType' defines the following possible values: 'document', 'int', 'float', 'string', 'date', 'double'.
The enumeration 'EEnumSubset' defines the following possible values: 'off', 'pro', 'exp', 'req'.

The enumeration 'EEnumOp' defines the following possible values: 'notification', 'requestresponse', 'solicitresponse', 'oneway'.
The enumeration 'EEnumDimensionType' defines the following possible values: 'antitonic', 'monotonic'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ASD_ServiceDescription' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_Operation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_Message' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_InfoType' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_Profile' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_AssertionSet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_Assertion' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ASD_InfoTypeImported' is a specialization of 'InfoType'.
