The domain model 'Lims' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'Lims_Sequencer' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Lims_Laboratory' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Lims_Family' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Lims_Sequenced' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Lims_Individual' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'gender', which is of type str.

'Lims_Run' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'date', which is of type date; 'name', which is of type str.

'Lims_Sample' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Gender' defines the following possible values: 'FEMALE', 'MALE', 'UNKNOWN'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Lims_Family' and 'Lims_Individual'. From 'Lims_Family', the role 'family' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Lims_Individual', the role 'Individual' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Lims_Family' and 'Lims_Laboratory'. From 'Lims_Family', the role 'families' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Lims_Laboratory', the role 'Laboratory' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Lims_Family' and 'Lims_Laboratory'. From 'Lims_Family', the role 'Family' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Lims_Laboratory', the role 'laboratory' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Lims_Laboratory' and 'Lims_Sequencer'. From 'Lims_Laboratory', the role 'laboratory4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Lims_Sequencer', the role 'Sequencer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Lims_Family' and 'Lims_Individual'. From 'Lims_Family', the role 'Family6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Lims_Individual', the role 'individuals' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Lims_Individual' and 'Lims_Individual'. From 'Lims_Individual', the role 'Lims_Individual7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Lims_Individual', the role 'Lims_Individual' has cardinality 0..*.
