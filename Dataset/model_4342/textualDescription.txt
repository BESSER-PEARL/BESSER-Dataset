The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'migration_ModelResource' is a specialization of 'AbstractResource'.
The class 'migration_AttributeSlot' is a specialization of 'Slot'.
The class 'migration_ReferenceSlot' is a specialization of 'Slot'.
The class 'migration_MetamodelResource' is a specialization of 'AbstractResource'.
