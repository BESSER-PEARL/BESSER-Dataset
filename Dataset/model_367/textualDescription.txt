The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'library_Library' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'library_Person' is a specialization of 'Addressable'.
The class 'library_Employee' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'library_Writer' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'library_Borrower' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'library_IncBook' is a specialization of 'CirculatingItem'.
The class 'library_CirculatingItem' is a specialization of 'Item'.
The class 'library_CirculatingItem' is a specialization of 'Lendable'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Writer'. From 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Writer', the role 'library_Writer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Employee' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Employee', the role 'library_Employee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Borrower'. From 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Borrower', the role 'library_Borrower' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Item' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Item', the role 'library_Item' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Writer' and 'library_IncBook'. From 'library_Writer', the role 'authors' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_IncBook', the role 'IncBook' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Lendable' and 'library_Borrower'. From 'library_Lendable', the role 'Lendable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Borrower', the role 'borrowers' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Writer' and 'library_IncBook'. From 'library_Writer', the role 'Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_IncBook', the role 'books' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Borrower' and 'library_Lendable'. From 'library_Borrower', the role 'Borrower' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Lendable', the role 'borrowing' has cardinality 0..*.
