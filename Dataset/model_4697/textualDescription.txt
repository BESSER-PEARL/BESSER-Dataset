The domain model 'familytree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'familytree_FamilyTree' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'familytree_Woman' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'familytree_Man' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'familytree_Person' and 'familytree_Person'. From 'familytree_Person', the role 'parents' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familytree_Person', the role 'Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familytree_Person' and 'familytree_Person'. From 'familytree_Person', the role 'Person4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familytree_Person', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familytree_Person' and 'familytree_Person'. From 'familytree_Person', the role 'Person7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familytree_Person', the role 'inRelationTo' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familytree_Person' and 'familytree_Person'. From 'familytree_Person', the role 'Person10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familytree_Person', the role 'inRelationWith' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familytree_FamilyTree' and 'familytree_Person'. From 'familytree_FamilyTree', the role 'familytree_FamilyTree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familytree_Person', the role 'familytree_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
