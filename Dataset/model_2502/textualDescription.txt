Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tfsm_Clock' and 'tfsm_TimedFSM'. From 'tfsm_Clock', the role 'tfsm_Clock' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tfsm_TimedFSM', the role 'tfsm_TimedFSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tfsm_TimedState' and 'tfsm_ClockConstraintOperation'. From 'tfsm_TimedState', the role 'tfsm_TimedState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tfsm_ClockConstraintOperation', the role 'tfsm_ClockConstraintOperation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tfsm_ClockReset' and 'tfsm_TimedTransition'. From 'tfsm_ClockReset', the role 'tfsm_ClockReset' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tfsm_TimedTransition', the role 'tfsm_TimedTransition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tfsm_TimedTransition' and 'tfsm_ClockConstraintOperation'. From 'tfsm_TimedTransition', the role 'tfsm_TimedTransition4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tfsm_ClockConstraintOperation', the role 'tfsm_ClockConstraintOperation5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tfsm_ClockConstraint' and 'tfsm_Clock'. From 'tfsm_ClockConstraint', the role 'tfsm_ClockConstraint' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tfsm_Clock', the role 'tfsm_Clock7' has cardinality 0..*.
