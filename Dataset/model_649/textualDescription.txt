It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'mm2_Member' represents an important domain concept.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mm2_Member' and 'mm2_Library'. From 'mm2_Member', the role 'mm2_Member' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mm2_Library', the role 'mm2_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mm2_Library' and 'mm2_Medium'. From 'mm2_Library', the role 'mm2_Library2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mm2_Medium', the role 'mm2_Medium' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mm2_Category' and 'mm2_Library'. From 'mm2_Category', the role 'mm2_Category' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mm2_Library', the role 'mm2_Library4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mm2_Category' and 'mm2_Category'. From 'mm2_Category', the role 'mm2_Category5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mm2_Category', the role 'mm2_Category7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mm2_Medium' and 'mm2_Category'. From 'mm2_Medium', the role 'mm2_Medium10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mm2_Category', the role 'mm2_Category9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mm2_Medium' and 'mm2_Member'. From 'mm2_Medium', the role 'mm2_Medium13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mm2_Member', the role 'mm2_Member12' has cardinality 0..*.
