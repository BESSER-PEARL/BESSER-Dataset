The domain model 'types' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'types_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'types_Library' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'types_Type' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'types_Feature' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'types_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'types_Operation' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'types_Property' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'types_Parameter' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'types_Parameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'types_Event' is a specialization of 'Feature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'types_Type' and 'types_Library'. From 'types_Type', the role 'Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Library', the role 'owningLibrary' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_Type' and 'types_Feature'. From 'types_Type', the role 'owningType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Feature', the role 'Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_Type' and 'types_Type'. From 'types_Type', the role 'types_Type2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Type', the role 'types_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_Type' and 'types_Library'. From 'types_Type', the role 'types' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Library', the role 'Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_Feature' and 'types_Type'. From 'types_Feature', the role 'features' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Type', the role 'Type6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_Operation' and 'types_Parameter'. From 'types_Operation', the role 'owningOperation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Parameter', the role 'Parameter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_Parameter' and 'types_Operation'. From 'types_Parameter', the role 'parameters' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Operation', the role 'Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'types_TypedElement' and 'types_Type'. From 'types_TypedElement', the role 'types_TypedElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'types_Type', the role 'types_Type10' has cardinality 0..*.
