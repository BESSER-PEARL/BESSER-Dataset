The domain model 'tests' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'tests_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ObjectIntersectionOf_A_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tests_ObjectUnionOf_A_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ObjectUnionOf_A_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tests_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tests_ObjectIntersectionOf_A_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tests_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tests_ObjectIntersectionOf_A_C' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'tests_ObjectIntersectionOf_A_C' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'tests_A' is a specialization of 'ObjectUnionOf_A_B'.
The class 'tests_B' is a specialization of 'ObjectIntersectionOf_A_C'.
The class 'tests_B' is a specialization of 'ObjectUnionOf_A_B'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tests_A' and 'tests_ObjectUnionOf_A_B'. From 'tests_A', the role 'tests_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tests_ObjectUnionOf_A_B', the role 'tests_ObjectUnionOf_A_B' has cardinality 0..*.
