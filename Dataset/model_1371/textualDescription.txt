The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'statemachine_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'trigger', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str.

'statemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine_StateMachine' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_StateMachine' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_StateMachine', the role 'statemachine_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'src' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'dst' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'out' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'in' has cardinality 0..*.
