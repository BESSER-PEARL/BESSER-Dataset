The domain model 'stochasticpetrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'stochasticpetrinet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stochasticpetrinet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stochasticpetrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tokens', which is of type int.

'stochasticpetrinet_TimedTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stochasticpetrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stochasticpetrinet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stochasticpetrinet_ImmediateTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ArcKind' defines the following possible values: 'OUTPUT', 'INPUT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'stochasticpetrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'stochasticpetrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'stochasticpetrinet_TimedTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'stochasticpetrinet_ImmediateTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'stochasticpetrinet_PetriNet' and 'stochasticpetrinet_Node'. From 'stochasticpetrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stochasticpetrinet_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc' and 'stochasticpetrinet_Transition'. From 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stochasticpetrinet_Transition', the role 'transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc' and 'stochasticpetrinet_Transition'. From 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc', the role 'arcs' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stochasticpetrinet_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stochasticpetrinet_Place' and 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc'. From 'stochasticpetrinet_Place', the role 'stochasticpetrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc', the role 'stochasticpetrinet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stochasticpetrinet_Node' and 'stochasticpetrinet_PetriNet'. From 'stochasticpetrinet_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stochasticpetrinet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
