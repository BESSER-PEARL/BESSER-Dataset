Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'family_Parent' and 'family_Child'. From 'family_Parent', the role 'family_Parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Child', the role 'family_Child' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Father' and 'family_Mother'. From 'family_Father', the role 'family_Father' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Mother', the role 'family_Mother' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Mother' and 'family_Father'. From 'family_Mother', the role 'family_Mother4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Father', the role 'family_Father3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Mother' and 'family_Child'. From 'family_Mother', the role 'family_Mother7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Child', the role 'family_Child6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Father' and 'family_Child'. From 'family_Father', the role 'family_Father10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Child', the role 'family_Child9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Family' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Family', the role 'family_Family' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
