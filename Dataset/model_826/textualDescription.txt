The domain model 'wheel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'wheel_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'wheel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'speed', which is of type str; 'time', which is of type str.

'wheel_WheelSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'wheel_WheelSM' and 'wheel_State'. From 'wheel_WheelSM', the role 'wheel_WheelSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_State', the role 'wheel_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_State' and 'wheel_WheelSM'. From 'wheel_State', the role 'wheel_State3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_WheelSM', the role 'wheel_WheelSM2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_WheelSM' and 'wheel_State'. From 'wheel_WheelSM', the role 'owningFSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_State' and 'wheel_Transition'. From 'wheel_State', the role 'wheel_State6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_Transition', the role 'wheel_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_State' and 'wheel_Transition'. From 'wheel_State', the role 'Source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_State' and 'wheel_WheelSM'. From 'wheel_State', the role 'ownedState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_WheelSM', the role 'WheelSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_Transition' and 'wheel_State'. From 'wheel_Transition', the role 'wheel_Transition10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_State', the role 'wheel_State11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'wheel_Transition' and 'wheel_State'. From 'wheel_Transition', the role 'outgoingTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'wheel_State', the role 'State13' has cardinality 0..*.
