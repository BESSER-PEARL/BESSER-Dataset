The domain model 'classes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'classes_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classes_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classes_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classes_DataType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'classes_Class' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classes_Class' and 'classes_Model'. From 'classes_Class', the role 'classes_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Model', the role 'classes_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Class' and 'classes_Attribute'. From 'classes_Class', the role 'classes_Class2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Attribute', the role 'classes_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Attribute' and 'classes_Type'. From 'classes_Attribute', the role 'classes_Attribute4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Type', the role 'classes_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
