The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'trace_ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'element_id', which is of type str.

'trace_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'trace_TraceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'trace_ModuleElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'module_id', which is of type str.

'TraceElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_ExecutionContext' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'scriptId', which is of type str; 'modelsIds', which is of type str.

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trace_ExecutionContext' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.
The class 'trace_ModuleElement' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.
The class 'trace_Trace' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.
The class 'trace_ModelElement' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.
The class 'trace_Property' is a specialization of 'TraceElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
