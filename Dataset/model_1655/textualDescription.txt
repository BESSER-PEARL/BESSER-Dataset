The domain model 'error4' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'error4_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'error4_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'error4_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'error4_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'error4_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'error4_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'error4_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'error4_Component' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'error4_Thing' and 'error4_World'. From 'error4_Thing', the role 'error4_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'error4_World', the role 'error4_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'error4_RelatedTo' and 'error4_Thing'. From 'error4_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'error4_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'error4_Thing' and 'error4_Component'. From 'error4_Thing', the role 'error4_Thing3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'error4_Component', the role 'error4_Component' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'error4_Thing' and 'error4_RelatedTo'. From 'error4_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'error4_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'error4_RelatedTo' and 'error4_Thing'. From 'error4_RelatedTo', the role 'error4_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'error4_Thing', the role 'error4_Thing6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'error4_RelatedTo' and 'error4_Component'. From 'error4_RelatedTo', the role 'error4_RelatedTo8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'error4_Component', the role 'error4_Component9' has cardinality 0..*.
