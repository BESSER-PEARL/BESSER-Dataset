The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Element' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'PetriNet_TransitionToPlace' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Element' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'Element', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Arc' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'Arc', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role '02' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Element' and 'PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Element', the role '05' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TransitionToPlace' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'TransitionToPlace', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role '08' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PlaceToTransition' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PlaceToTransition', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role '011' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PlaceToTransition' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PlaceToTransition', the role '15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role '014' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TransitionToPlace' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'TransitionToPlace', the role '18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role '017' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role '020' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet', the role '21' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' and 'Place'. From 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition', the role '023' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Place', the role '24' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' and 'Transition'. From 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition', the role '026' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Transition', the role '27' has cardinality 0..*.
