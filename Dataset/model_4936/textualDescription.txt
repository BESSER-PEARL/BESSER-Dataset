Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DateFormat' defines the following possible values: 'DayMonthYear', 'YearMonthDay'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'webapp_FormPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'webapp_NormalPage' is a specialization of 'Page'.
The class 'webapp_Label' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_Label' is a specialization of 'NormalControl'.
The class 'webapp_Link' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_Link' is a specialization of 'NormalControl'.
The class 'webapp_TextBox' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_DropDownList' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_RadioButton' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_CheckBox' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_NormalControl' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_FormButton' is a specialization of 'Control'.
The class 'webapp_ResetButton' is a specialization of 'FormButton'.
The class 'webapp_NormalButton' is a specialization of 'NormalControl'.
The class 'webapp_PasswordBox' is a specialization of 'TextBox'.
The class 'webapp_EmailBox' is a specialization of 'TextBox'.
The class 'webapp_DateBox' is a specialization of 'TextBox'.
The class 'webapp_SubmitButton' is a specialization of 'FormButton'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'webapp_Page' and 'webapp_FormPage'. From 'webapp_Page', the role 'webapp_Page' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_FormPage', the role 'webapp_FormPage' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_FormPage' and 'webapp_Page'. From 'webapp_FormPage', the role 'webapp_FormPage2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_Page', the role 'webapp_Page3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_FormPage' and 'webapp_Control'. From 'webapp_FormPage', the role 'webapp_FormPage5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_Control', the role 'webapp_Control' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_NormalPage' and 'webapp_NormalControl'. From 'webapp_NormalPage', the role 'webapp_NormalPage' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_NormalControl', the role 'webapp_NormalControl' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_Page' and 'webapp_Link'. From 'webapp_Page', the role 'webapp_Page8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_Link', the role 'webapp_Link' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_DropDownList' and 'webapp_ListElement'. From 'webapp_DropDownList', the role 'webapp_DropDownList' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_ListElement', the role 'webapp_ListElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_RadioButton' and 'webapp_ListElement'. From 'webapp_RadioButton', the role 'webapp_RadioButton' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_ListElement', the role 'webapp_ListElement11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'webapp_Page' and 'webapp_DynamicWebApp'. From 'webapp_Page', the role 'webapp_Page13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'webapp_DynamicWebApp', the role 'webapp_DynamicWebApp' has cardinality 0..*.
