The domain model 'TypeD' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'TypeD_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeD_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeD_BElementName' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeD_AElementName' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeD_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TypeD_B' and 'TypeD_A'. From 'TypeD_B', the role 'TypeD_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeD_A', the role 'TypeD_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TypeD_B' and 'TypeD_A'. From 'TypeD_B', the role 'TypeD_B2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeD_A', the role 'TypeD_A3' has cardinality 0..*.
