The domain model 'xyz' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'xyz_Z' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'xyz_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'xyz_X' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'xyz_X' and 'xyz_Y'. From 'xyz_X', the role 'xyz_X' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'xyz_Y', the role 'xyz_Y' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'xyz_Z' and 'xyz_Y'. From 'xyz_Z', the role 'xyz_Z' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'xyz_Y', the role 'xyz_Y2' has cardinality 0..*.
