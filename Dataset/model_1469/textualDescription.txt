The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'graph_GraphModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_GraphModel'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_GraphModel', the role 'graph_GraphModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_GraphModel' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_GraphModel', the role 'graph_GraphModel2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node8' has cardinality 0..*.
