The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'test_EClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_EClassToEStringMap' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'test_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'yList', which is of type int; 'x', which is of type str.

'test_EClassToAMap' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_A' and 'test_B'. From 'test_A', the role 'test_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_B', the role 'test_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_B' and 'test_C'. From 'test_B', the role 'test_B2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_C', the role 'test_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_B' and 'test_C'. From 'test_B', the role 'test_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_C', the role 'test_C5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_D' and 'test_C'. From 'test_D', the role 'test_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_C', the role 'test_C7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_EClassToEStringMap' and 'test_C'. From 'test_EClassToEStringMap', the role 'test_EClassToEStringMap' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_C', the role 'test_C9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_C' and 'test_EClassToAMap'. From 'test_C', the role 'test_C11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_EClassToAMap', the role 'test_EClassToAMap' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_A' and 'test_C'. From 'test_A', the role 'test_A14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_C', the role 'test_C13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_EClassToEStringMap' and 'test_EClass'. From 'test_EClassToEStringMap', the role 'test_EClassToEStringMap16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_EClass', the role 'test_EClass' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_EClass' and 'test_EClassToAMap'. From 'test_EClass', the role 'test_EClass19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_EClassToAMap', the role 'test_EClassToAMap18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_EClassToAMap' and 'test_A'. From 'test_EClassToAMap', the role 'test_EClassToAMap21' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_A', the role 'test_A22' has cardinality 0..*.
