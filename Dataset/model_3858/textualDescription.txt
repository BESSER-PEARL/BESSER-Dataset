Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'grammarSql_Model' and 'grammarSql_Table'. From 'grammarSql_Model', the role 'grammarSql_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_Table', the role 'grammarSql_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammarSql_EObject' and 'grammarSql_Table'. From 'grammarSql_EObject', the role 'grammarSql_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_Table', the role 'grammarSql_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammarSql_Column' and 'grammarSql_PrimaryKey'. From 'grammarSql_Column', the role 'grammarSql_Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_PrimaryKey', the role 'grammarSql_PrimaryKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammarSql_ForeignKey' and 'grammarSql_Column'. From 'grammarSql_ForeignKey', the role 'grammarSql_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_Column', the role 'grammarSql_Column5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammarSql_ForeignKey' and 'grammarSql_Reference'. From 'grammarSql_ForeignKey', the role 'grammarSql_ForeignKey7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_Reference', the role 'grammarSql_Reference' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammarSql_Table' and 'grammarSql_Reference'. From 'grammarSql_Table', the role 'grammarSql_Table10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_Reference', the role 'grammarSql_Reference9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'grammarSql_Reference' and 'grammarSql_Column'. From 'grammarSql_Reference', the role 'grammarSql_Reference12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'grammarSql_Column', the role 'grammarSql_Column13' has cardinality 0..*.
