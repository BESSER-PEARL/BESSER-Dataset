Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mil_Instruction' and 'mil_MILModel'. From 'mil_Instruction', the role 'mil_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_MILModel', the role 'mil_MILModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_LoadInstruction' and 'mil_Value'. From 'mil_LoadInstruction', the role 'mil_LoadInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_Value', the role 'mil_Value' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_StoreInstruction' and 'mil_RegisterReference'. From 'mil_StoreInstruction', the role 'mil_StoreInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_RegisterReference', the role 'mil_RegisterReference' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_LabelInstruction' and 'mil_JumpInstruction'. From 'mil_LabelInstruction', the role 'mil_LabelInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_JumpInstruction', the role 'mil_JumpInstruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_CallInstruction' and 'mil_LabelInstruction'. From 'mil_CallInstruction', the role 'mil_CallInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_LabelInstruction', the role 'mil_LabelInstruction5' has cardinality 0..*.
