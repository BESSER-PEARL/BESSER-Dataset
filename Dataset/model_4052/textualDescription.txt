The class 'smalluml_Infinity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Enumeration' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Enumeration' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'smalluml_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Method' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Relation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Cardinality' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'smalluml_Generalisation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smalluml_String' and 'smalluml_Enumeration'. From 'smalluml_String', the role 'smalluml_String' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Enumeration', the role 'smalluml_Enumeration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smalluml_Attribute' and 'smalluml_Class'. From 'smalluml_Attribute', the role 'smalluml_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smalluml_Class', the role 'smalluml_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
