The enumeration 'VariableCharacterisationType' defines the following possible values: 'STRUCTURE', 'BYTESIZE', 'NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS', 'TYPE', 'VALUE'.
The enumeration 'PrimitiveTypeEnum' defines the following possible values: 'BOOL', 'INT', 'DOUBLE', 'CHAR', 'LONG', 'STRING', 'BYTE'.
The enumeration 'ComponentType' defines the following possible values: 'BUSINESS_COMPONENT', 'INFRASTRUCTURE_COMPONENT'.
The enumeration 'ParameterModifier' defines the following possible values: 'inout', 'in', 'none', 'out'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
