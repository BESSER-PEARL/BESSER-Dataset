The domain model 'c' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'c_AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'c_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

'c_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'c_Foo' is a specialization of 'AbstractClass'.
The class 'c_Bar' is a specialization of 'Foo'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'c_Foo' and 'c_Bar'. From 'c_Foo', the role 'c_Foo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'c_Bar', the role 'c_Bar' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'c_Bar' and 'c_Foo'. From 'c_Bar', the role 'c_Bar2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'c_Foo', the role 'c_Foo3' has cardinality 0..*.
