The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'input', which is of type str; 'output', which is of type str.

'fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'owningFSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'ownedState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role 'Transition8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'outgoingTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'State10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'incomingTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'State12' has cardinality 0..*.
