The domain model 'calculatrice' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'calculatrice_Calculatrice' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'calculatrice_BoolExpr' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'op', which is of type str.

'CalcExpr' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'calculatrice_Calc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'varName', which is of type str; 'decl', which is of type bool; 'boolName', which is of type str.

'Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'calculatrice_VarCall' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'varCall', which is of type str.

'Calc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BoolExpr' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'calculatrice_Number' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type int; 'neg', which is of type bool.

'calculatrice_CalcExpr' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'op', which is of type str.

'calculatrice_Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'calculatrice_Boolean' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'BoolValue', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'calculatrice_Condition' is a specialization of 'Calc'.
The class 'calculatrice_BoolExpr' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'calculatrice_Number' is a specialization of 'CalcExpr'.
The class 'calculatrice_VarCall' is a specialization of 'CalcExpr'.
The class 'calculatrice_Boolean' is a specialization of 'BoolExpr'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
