The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'test_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'N' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_test2_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nb', which is of type int; 'nb2', which is of type int.

'B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_N' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'n', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'test_A' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'test_test2_B' is a specialization of 'N'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_A' and 'B'. From 'test_A', the role 'test_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*.
