The domain model 'CST' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'CST_RNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'CST_Tree' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'CST_TNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'CST_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'CST_RNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'CST_TNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'CST_Tree' and 'CST_Node'. From 'CST_Tree', the role 'CST_Tree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CST_Node', the role 'CST_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'CST_Node' and 'CST_Node'. From 'CST_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CST_Node', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'CST_Node' and 'CST_Node'. From 'CST_Node', the role 'Node5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CST_Node', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
