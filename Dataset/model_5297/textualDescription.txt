The domain model 'tderived' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tderived_B2' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'anotherName', which is of type str.

'B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tderived_A2' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tderived_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tderived_A2' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'tderived_B2' is a specialization of 'B'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tderived_D' and 'tderived_A2'. From 'tderived_D', the role 'tderived_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tderived_A2', the role 'tderived_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
