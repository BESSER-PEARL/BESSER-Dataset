The domain model 'rdbmsMM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbmsMM_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbmsMM_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'rdbmsMM_Key' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbmsMM_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbmsMM_RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'kind', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'rdbmsMM_Column' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbmsMM_Key' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbmsMM_Schema' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbmsMM_Table' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rdbmsMM_Table' and 'rdbmsMM_Column'. From 'rdbmsMM_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbmsMM_Column', the role 'column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbmsMM_Column' and 'rdbmsMM_Key'. From 'rdbmsMM_Column', the role 'column2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbmsMM_Key', the role 'Key' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey' and 'rdbmsMM_Column'. From 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey', the role 'ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbmsMM_Column', the role 'column4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey' and 'rdbmsMM_Schema'. From 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey', the role 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbmsMM_Schema', the role 'rdbmsMM_Schema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbmsMM_Key' and 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey'. From 'rdbmsMM_Key', the role 'Key7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbmsMM_ForeignKey', the role 'referedBy' has cardinality 0..*.
