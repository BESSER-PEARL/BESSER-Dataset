The domain model 'university' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'university_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semester', which is of type int; 'MNR', which is of type str.

'university_Certificate' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'note', which is of type int.

'university_University' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'averageLength', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str; 'numberOfStudents', which is of type int.

'university_Professor' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'university_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'gradeAverage', which is of type float; 'numberOfAttendants', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'university_Course' and 'university_Professor'. From 'university_Course', the role 'courses' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Professor', the role 'Professor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Course' and 'university_Certificate'. From 'university_Course', the role 'course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Certificate', the role 'Certificate' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Course' and 'university_Professor'. From 'university_Course', the role 'Course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Professor', the role 'professor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_University' and 'university_Professor'. From 'university_University', the role 'university_University' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Professor', the role 'university_Professor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Course' and 'university_University'. From 'university_Course', the role 'university_Course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_University', the role 'university_University5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_University' and 'university_Student'. From 'university_University', the role 'university_University7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Student', the role 'university_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_University' and 'university_Certificate'. From 'university_University', the role 'university_University9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Certificate', the role 'university_Certificate' has cardinality 0..*.
