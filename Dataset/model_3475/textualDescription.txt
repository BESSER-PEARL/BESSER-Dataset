The domain model 'feature' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'FeatureTreeNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'feature_FeatureModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'feature_FeatureTreeNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'maxCardinality', which is of type int; 'minCardinality', which is of type int.

'feature_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'expression', which is of type str; 'language', which is of type str.

'feature_Annotation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'feature_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'feature_Group' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'feature_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'feature_Feature' is a specialization of 'FeatureTreeNode'.
The class 'feature_Group' is a specialization of 'FeatureTreeNode'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'feature_FeatureModel' and 'feature_Constraint'. From 'feature_FeatureModel', the role 'feature_FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'feature_Constraint', the role 'feature_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'feature_FeatureModel' and 'feature_Feature'. From 'feature_FeatureModel', the role 'feature_FeatureModel2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'feature_Feature', the role 'feature_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'feature_FeatureModel' and 'feature_FeatureModel'. From 'feature_FeatureModel', the role 'FeatureModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'feature_FeatureModel', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'feature_FeatureModel' and 'feature_FeatureModel'. From 'feature_FeatureModel', the role 'FeatureModel7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'feature_FeatureModel', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
