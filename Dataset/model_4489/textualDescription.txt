Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ActionEnum' defines the following possible values: 'STOP', 'FORWARD', 'BACKWARD'.
The enumeration 'EdgeEnum' defines the following possible values: 'FRONTRIGHT', 'FRONTLEFT', 'BACK'.
The enumeration 'TouchEnum' defines the following possible values: 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.
The enumeration 'ColorEnum' defines the following possible values: 'YELLOW', 'GREEN', 'BROWN', 'NONE', 'WHITE', 'BLACK', 'BLUE', 'RED'.
The enumeration 'LREnum' defines the following possible values: 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.
The enumeration 'FBEnum' defines the following possible values: 'BACKWARD', 'FORWARD'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dSL_LeftMovementAction' is a specialization of 'Actions'.
The class 'dSL_RightMovementAction' is a specialization of 'Actions'.
The class 'dSL_RotateMovementAction' is a specialization of 'Actions'.
The class 'dSL_RotatePoints' is a specialization of 'RotateMovementAction'.
The class 'dSL_LeftRotatePoint' is a specialization of 'RotatePoints'.
The class 'dSL_RightRotatePoint' is a specialization of 'RotatePoints'.
The class 'dSL_MiddleRotatePoint' is a specialization of 'RotatePoints'.
The class 'dSL_ExpressionBracket' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'dSL_TouchLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'dSL_ColorLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'dSL_DistanceLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'dSL_EdgeLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'dSL_ANDexpression' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'dSL_ORexpression' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
