The domain model 'myPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'subsub_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MyClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myPackage_subsub_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 's', which is of type str.

'myPackage_AThirdClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'thirdAttribute', which is of type str.

'myPackage_MyOtherClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'otherAttribute', which is of type str.

'myPackage_MyClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'myAttribute', which is of type str.

'myPackage_subPackage_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'subPackage_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myPackage_subsub_Baz' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myPackage_AThirdClass' is a specialization of 'MyClass'.
The class 'myPackage_subPackage_Foo' is a specialization of 'MyClass'.
The class 'myPackage_subsub_Baz' is a specialization of 'subsub_Bar'.
The class 'myPackage_subsub_Baz' is a specialization of 'subPackage_Foo'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myPackage_MyClass' and 'myPackage_MyOtherClass'. From 'myPackage_MyClass', the role 'myPackage_MyClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myPackage_MyOtherClass', the role 'myPackage_MyOtherClass' has cardinality 0..*.
