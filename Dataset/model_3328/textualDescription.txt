The domain model 'PrimitiveTypes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 28 main class(es).

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Java_VoidType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Java_ObjectType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Java_PrimitiveType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Java_Class' is a specialization of 'ObjectType'.
The class 'Java_Interface' is a specialization of 'ObjectType'.
The class 'Java_Method' is a specialization of 'MethodSignature'.
The class 'Java_MethodCall' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'Java_VariableDeclaration' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'Java_Assignment' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'Java_Return' is a specialization of 'Statement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ObjectType' and 'Java_Package'. From 'ObjectType', the role '#' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Java_Package', the role '0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_ObjectType' and 'Package'. From 'Java_ObjectType', the role '02' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Package', the role '#3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Class' and 'Interface'. From 'Java_Class', the role 'Java_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Interface', the role 'Interface' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Class' and 'Class'. From 'Java_Class', the role 'Java_Class6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Java_Class' and 'Field'. From 'Java_Class', the role '08' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Field', the role '#9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Method' and 'Java_Class'. From 'Method', the role 'Method' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Java_Class', the role 'Java_Class11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Interface' and 'Java_Interface'. From 'Interface', the role 'Interface13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Java_Interface', the role 'Java_Interface' has cardinality 0..*.
