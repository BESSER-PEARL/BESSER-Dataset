The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'afmmm_Mandatory' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'afmmm_Optional' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'afmmm_Mutex' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'afmmm_XOr' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'afmmm_Or' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'afmmm_Boolean' is a specialization of 'Domain'.
The class 'afmmm_Integer' is a specialization of 'Domain'.
The class 'afmmm_Real' is a specialization of 'Domain'.
The class 'afmmm_Enum' is a specialization of 'Domain'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'afmmm_Feature' and 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram'. From 'afmmm_Feature', the role 'afmmm_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram', the role 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram' and 'afmmm_Feature'. From 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram', the role 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'afmmm_Feature', the role 'afmmm_Feature3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram' and 'afmmm_CrossTreeConstraint'. From 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram', the role 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'afmmm_CrossTreeConstraint', the role 'afmmm_CrossTreeConstraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram' and 'afmmm_Relation'. From 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram', the role 'afmmm_AttributedFeatureDiagram7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'afmmm_Relation', the role 'afmmm_Relation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'afmmm_Attribute' and 'afmmm_Feature'. From 'afmmm_Attribute', the role 'afmmm_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'afmmm_Feature', the role 'afmmm_Feature9' has cardinality 0..*.
