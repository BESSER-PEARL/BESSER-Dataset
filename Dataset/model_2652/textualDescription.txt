Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_BehavioralFeature' and 'UML2WithID_Behavior'. From 'UML2WithID_BehavioralFeature', the role 'UML2WithID_BehavioralFeature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_Behavior', the role 'UML2WithID_Behavior' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_Behavior' and 'UML2WithID_BehavioredClassifier'. From 'UML2WithID_Behavior', the role 'UML2WithID_Behavior2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_BehavioredClassifier', the role 'UML2WithID_BehavioredClassifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2WithID_Behavior' and 'UML2WithID_BehavioredClassifier'. From 'UML2WithID_Behavior', the role 'UML2WithID_Behavior5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2WithID_BehavioredClassifier', the role 'UML2WithID_BehavioredClassifier4' has cardinality 0..*.
