The domain model 'test1' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'test1_StringToIntegerMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'key', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'test1_ConceptA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test1_ConceptA' and 'test1_StringToIntegerMapEntry'. From 'test1_ConceptA', the role 'test1_ConceptA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test1_StringToIntegerMapEntry', the role 'test1_StringToIntegerMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
