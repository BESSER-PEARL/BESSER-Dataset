The domain model 'p2' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'p2_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'application', which is of type str.

'p2_Vendor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p2_License' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Tool' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p2_Copyright' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Bundle' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p2_DiscoverySite' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p2_Plugin' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'FeatureMetadata' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p2_Description' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'p2_FeatureMetadata' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'text', which is of type str.

'LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'p2_Feature' is a specialization of 'Tool'.
The class 'p2_Copyright' is a specialization of 'FeatureMetadata'.
The class 'p2_Description' is a specialization of 'FeatureMetadata'.
The class 'p2_DiscoverySite' is a specialization of 'FeatureMetadata'.
The class 'p2_License' is a specialization of 'FeatureMetadata'.
The class 'p2_Plugin' is a specialization of 'Bundle'.
The class 'p2_FeatureMetadata' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'p2_Copyright' and 'p2_Feature'. From 'p2_Copyright', the role 'p2_Copyright' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p2_Feature', the role 'p2_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p2_Description' and 'p2_Feature'. From 'p2_Description', the role 'p2_Description' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p2_Feature', the role 'p2_Feature2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p2_DiscoverySite' and 'p2_Feature'. From 'p2_DiscoverySite', the role 'p2_DiscoverySite' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p2_Feature', the role 'p2_Feature4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p2_License' and 'p2_Feature'. From 'p2_License', the role 'p2_License' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p2_Feature', the role 'p2_Feature6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p2_Feature' and 'p2_Vendor'. From 'p2_Feature', the role 'p2_Feature8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p2_Vendor', the role 'p2_Vendor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'p2_Plugin' and 'p2_Feature'. From 'p2_Plugin', the role 'p2_Plugin' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'p2_Feature', the role 'p2_Feature10' has cardinality 0..*.
