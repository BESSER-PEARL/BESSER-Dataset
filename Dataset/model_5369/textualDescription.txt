The domain model 'RHS' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'RHS_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'RHS_X' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'RHS_X' and 'RHS_Y'. From 'RHS_X', the role 'RHS_X' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'RHS_Y', the role 'RHS_Y' has cardinality 0..*.
