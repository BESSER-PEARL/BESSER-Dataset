The domain model 'emfdb' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'emfdb_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'key', which is of type str.

'emfdb_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'string', which is of type str.

'emfdb_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'string', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'emfdb_A' and 'emfdb_B'. From 'emfdb_A', the role 'emfdb_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'emfdb_B', the role 'emfdb_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'emfdb_A' and 'emfdb_C'. From 'emfdb_A', the role 'emfdb_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'emfdb_C', the role 'emfdb_C' has cardinality 0..*.
