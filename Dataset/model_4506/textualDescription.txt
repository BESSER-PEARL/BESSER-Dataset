Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'IntegerOperator' defines the following possible values: 'SUPERIOR', 'EQUALS', 'INFERIOR'.
The enumeration 'BooleanOperator' defines the following possible values: 'IS', 'IS_NOT'.
The enumeration 'DurationUnit' defines the following possible values: 'MINUTE', 'SECOND'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'smartHome_IntegerSensor' is a specialization of 'Sensor'.
The class 'smartHome_BooleanSensor' is a specialization of 'Sensor'.
The class 'smartHome_AnalogSensorType' is a specialization of 'SensorType'.
The class 'smartHome_BooleanSensorType' is a specialization of 'SensorType'.
The class 'smartHome_BooleanCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'smartHome_IntegerCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'smartHome_SensorType' and 'smartHome_Sensor'. From 'smartHome_SensorType', the role 'smartHome_SensorType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_Sensor', the role 'smartHome_Sensor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_Location' and 'smartHome_Sensor'. From 'smartHome_Location', the role 'smartHome_Location' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_Sensor', the role 'smartHome_Sensor2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_Location' and 'smartHome_SmartHome'. From 'smartHome_Location', the role 'smartHome_Location4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_SmartHome', the role 'smartHome_SmartHome' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_SmartHome' and 'smartHome_SensorType'. From 'smartHome_SmartHome', the role 'smartHome_SmartHome6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_SensorType', the role 'smartHome_SensorType7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'smartHome_SmartHome' and 'smartHome_Rule'. From 'smartHome_SmartHome', the role 'smartHome_SmartHome9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'smartHome_Rule', the role 'smartHome_Rule' has cardinality 0..*.
