An association connects 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalSchema' and 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable'. From 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalSchema', the role 'RelationalSchema' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable', the role 'Tables' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalForeignKey' and 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable'. From 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalForeignKey', the role 'RelationalForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable', the role 'OwnedByTable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable' and 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalForeignKey'. From 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable', the role 'ReferencedTable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalForeignKey', the role 'RelationalForeignKey4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable' and 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalForeignKey'. From 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalTable', the role 'RelationalTable6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationalMetaModel_RelationalForeignKey', the role 'ForeignKeys' has cardinality 0..*.
