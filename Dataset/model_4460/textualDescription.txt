Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Operator' defines the following possible values: 'AND', 'OR'.
The enumeration 'Signal' defines the following possible values: 'LOW', 'HIGH'.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'digital', 'analog'.
The enumeration 'Comparator' defines the following possible values: 'equ', 'esup', 'sup', 'einf', 'inf'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'arduinoML_Brick' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_App' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_BaseCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'arduinoML_BooleanCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
