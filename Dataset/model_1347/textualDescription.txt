The domain model 'classes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 21 main class(es).

The class 'classes_Operation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classes_Operation' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'classes_Parameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classes_PropertyCallExp' is a specialization of 'CallExp'.
The class 'classes_OperationCallExp' is a specialization of 'CallExp'.
The class 'classes_Argument' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classes_Class' and 'classes_TypedElement'. From 'classes_Class', the role 'classes_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_TypedElement', the role 'classes_TypedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_CallExp' and 'classes_CallExp'. From 'classes_CallExp', the role 'CallExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_CallExp', the role 'owningSource' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_CallExp' and 'classes_CallExp'. From 'classes_CallExp', the role 'ownedCallExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_CallExp', the role 'CallExp5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Root' and 'classes_Package'. From 'classes_Root', the role 'classes_Root' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Package', the role 'classes_Package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Class' and 'classes_Package'. From 'classes_Class', the role 'classes_Class9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Package', the role 'classes_Package8' has cardinality 0..*.
