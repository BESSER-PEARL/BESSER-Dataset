It does not declare any attributes.

'stateMachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_States' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stateMachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stateMachine_Variables' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stateMachine_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_Event' represents an important domain concept.
