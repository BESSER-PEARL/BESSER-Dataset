The domain model 'stateMachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'stateMachine_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_VarName' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_StringType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stateMachine_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Visibility' defines the following possible values: 'Final', 'Initial'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'stateMachine_StringType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'stateMachine_FloatType' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'stateMachine_StateMachine' and 'stateMachine_model'. From 'stateMachine_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_model', the role 'stateMachine_model' has cardinality 0..*.
