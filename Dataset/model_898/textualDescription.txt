The domain model 'SimplePDL' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'SimplePDL_ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimplePDL_ResourceType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'occurrences', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'SimplePDL_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'maxTime', which is of type int; 'minTime', which is of type int.

'ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimplePDL_WorkSequence' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'linkType', which is of type str.

'SimplePDL_Resource' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'occurrences', which is of type int.

'SimplePDL_Guidance' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'SimplePDL_WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'maxTime', which is of type int; 'minTime', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'WorkSequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'finishToFinish', 'startToFinish', 'startToStart', 'finishToStart'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SimplePDL_WorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'SimplePDL_WorkSequence' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'SimplePDL_ResourceType' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'SimplePDL_Resource' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimplePDL_ProcessElement' and 'SimplePDL_Process'. From 'SimplePDL_ProcessElement', the role 'SimplePDL_ProcessElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimplePDL_Process', the role 'SimplePDL_Process' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimplePDL_Process' and 'SimplePDL_Guidance'. From 'SimplePDL_Process', the role 'SimplePDL_Process2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimplePDL_Guidance', the role 'SimplePDL_Guidance' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimplePDL_WorkDefinition' and 'SimplePDL_WorkSequence'. From 'SimplePDL_WorkDefinition', the role 'successor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimplePDL_WorkSequence', the role 'WorkSequence' has cardinality 0..*.
