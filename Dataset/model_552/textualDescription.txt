The class 'family_Person' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'family_Family' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'family_Members' and 'family_Person'. From 'family_Members', the role 'family_Members' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Person', the role 'family_Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'family_Family' and 'family_Members'. From 'family_Family', the role 'family_Family' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'family_Members', the role 'family_Members2' has cardinality 0..*.
