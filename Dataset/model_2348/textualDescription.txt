The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplerdbms_Column' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Key' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Primary_Key' is a specialization of 'Key'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Schema' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'simplerdbms_Table' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
