Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ToleranceMarkerDirectionKind' defines the following possible values: 'DOWN', 'UP', 'START'.
The enumeration 'MarkerKind' defines the following possible values: 'value', 'TOLERANCECROSSED', 'INTERNALEVENT', 'EXTERNALEVENT', 'ACTIONNEEDED'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
