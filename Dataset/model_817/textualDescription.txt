It has the following attributes: 'input', which is of type str; 'output', which is of type str.

'fsmSample_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsmSample_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsmSample_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
