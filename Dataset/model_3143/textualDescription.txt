The domain model 'USE' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 16 main class(es).

'USE_Enumeration' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'USE_OCLExpression' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'expr', which is of type str.

'USE_SimpleType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'USE_Role' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'upperBound', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str; 'ordered', which is of type bool; 'lowerBound', which is of type int.

'USE_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'USE_ReferenceType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'USE_CollectionType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'USE_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'USE_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'abstract', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'USE_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AssocKind' defines the following possible values: 'Association', 'Composition', 'Aggregation'.
The enumeration 'SimpleTypes' defines the following possible values: 'String', 'Integer', 'Real', 'Boolean'.
The enumeration 'CollectionTypes' defines the following possible values: 'Set', 'Bag', 'Sequence'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'USE_EnumerationType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'USE_CollectionType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'USE_SimpleType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'USE_ReferenceType' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'USE_Class' and 'USE_Class'. From 'USE_Class', the role 'USE_Class0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'USE_Class', the role 'USE_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'USE_Class' and 'USE_Attribute'. From 'USE_Class', the role 'USE_Class3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'USE_Attribute', the role 'USE_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
