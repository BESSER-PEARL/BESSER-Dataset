The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_TimedTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'fsm_Pseudostate' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_Fork' is a specialization of 'Pseudostate'.
The class 'fsm_Join' is a specialization of 'Pseudostate'.
The class 'fsm_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_Choice' is a specialization of 'Pseudostate'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_StateMachine' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Variable' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_Variable', the role 'fsm_Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
