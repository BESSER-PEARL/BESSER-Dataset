The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mathInterpreter_Plus' is a specialization of 'PlusOrMinus'.
The class 'mathInterpreter_Minus' is a specialization of 'PlusOrMinus'.
The class 'mathInterpreter_Multiply' is a specialization of 'MultiplyOrDivide'.
The class 'mathInterpreter_Divide' is a specialization of 'MultiplyOrDivide'.
The class 'mathInterpreter_Num' is a specialization of 'Primary'.
The class 'mathInterpreter_VariableRef' is a specialization of 'Primary'.
The class 'mathInterpreter_Bracket' is a specialization of 'Primary'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mathInterpreter_Solution' and 'mathInterpreter_Variable'. From 'mathInterpreter_Solution', the role 'mathInterpreter_Solution' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathInterpreter_Variable', the role 'mathInterpreter_Variable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathInterpreter_Expression' and 'mathInterpreter_Solution'. From 'mathInterpreter_Expression', the role 'mathInterpreter_Expression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathInterpreter_Solution', the role 'mathInterpreter_Solution2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathInterpreter_Variable' and 'mathInterpreter_Expression'. From 'mathInterpreter_Variable', the role 'mathInterpreter_Variable4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathInterpreter_Expression', the role 'mathInterpreter_Expression5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathInterpreter_Expression' and 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus'. From 'mathInterpreter_Expression', the role 'mathInterpreter_Expression7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus', the role 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathInterpreter_EObject' and 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus'. From 'mathInterpreter_EObject', the role 'mathInterpreter_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus', the role 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathInterpreter_PlusOrMinus' and 'mathInterpreter_MultiplyOrDivide'.
