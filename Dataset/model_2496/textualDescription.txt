The domain model 'y4fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'y4fsm_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'y4fsm_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'zoo', which is of type str.

'y4fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'y4fsm_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'baz', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'y4fsm_Region' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'y4fsm_State' and 'y4fsm_Region'. From 'y4fsm_State', the role 'y4fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'y4fsm_Region', the role 'y4fsm_Region' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'y4fsm_State' and 'y4fsm_Foo'. From 'y4fsm_State', the role 'y4fsm_State2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'y4fsm_Foo', the role 'y4fsm_Foo' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'y4fsm_State' and 'y4fsm_Bar'. From 'y4fsm_State', the role 'y4fsm_State4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'y4fsm_Bar', the role 'y4fsm_Bar' has cardinality 0..*.
