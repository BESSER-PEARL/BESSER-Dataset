The class 'workflow_OutputPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'workflow_Fault' is a specialization of 'OutputPort'.
The class 'workflow_CompoundTask' is a specialization of 'WorkflowNode'.
The class 'workflow_Port' is a specialization of 'WorkflowElement'.
The class 'workflow_TransformationTask' is a specialization of 'WorkflowNode'.
The class 'workflow_ConditionalTask' is a specialization of 'WorkflowNode'.
The class 'workflow_LoopTask' is a specialization of 'CompoundTask'.
The class 'workflow_ConditionalOutputPort' is a specialization of 'OutputPort'.
The class 'workflow_Comment' is a specialization of 'WorkflowElement'.
The class 'workflow_Task' is a specialization of 'WorkflowNode'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'workflow_WorkflowNode' and 'workflow_Workflow'. From 'workflow_WorkflowNode', the role 'WorkflowNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_Workflow', the role 'workflow' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_Workflow' and 'workflow_Edge'. From 'workflow_Workflow', the role 'workflow2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
