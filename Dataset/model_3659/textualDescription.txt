The domain model 'Projects' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Project' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Projects_Company' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Projects_Project' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'size', which is of type str; 'status', which is of type str.

'Projects_Worker' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'salary', which is of type int; 'nickname', which is of type str.

'Projects_Training' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Projects_Qualification' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'description', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ProjectSize' defines the following possible values: 'big', 'small', 'medium'.
The enumeration 'ProjectStatus' defines the following possible values: 'active', 'planned', 'finished', 'suspended'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Projects_Training' is a specialization of 'Project'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Projects_Project' and 'Projects_Company'. From 'Projects_Project', the role 'Project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Projects_Company', the role 'company' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Projects_Worker' and 'Projects_Company'. From 'Projects_Worker', the role 'Worker' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Projects_Company', the role 'employer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Projects_Company' and 'Projects_Worker'. From 'Projects_Company', the role 'Company' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Projects_Worker', the role 'employees' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Projects_Qualification' and 'Projects_Worker'. From 'Projects_Qualification', the role 'Qualification' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Projects_Worker', the role 'workers' has cardinality 0..*.
