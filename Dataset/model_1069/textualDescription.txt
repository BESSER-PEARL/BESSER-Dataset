The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petriNet_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'petriNet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petriNet_Element' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'petriNet_PlaceToTransition' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petriNet_TransitionToPlace' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petriNet_PetriNet' and 'petriNet_Element'. From 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'net' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Element', the role 'Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Arc' and 'petriNet_PetriNet'. From 'petriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'net2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Element' and 'petriNet_PetriNet'. From 'petriNet_Element', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_TransitionToPlace' and 'petriNet_Place'. From 'petriNet_TransitionToPlace', the role 'TransitionToPlace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_Place', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petriNet_Place' and 'petriNet_PlaceToTransition'. From 'petriNet_Place', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petriNet_PlaceToTransition', the role 'PlaceToTransition' has cardinality 0..*.
