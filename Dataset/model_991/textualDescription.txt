The domain model 'dfs' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'dfs_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'postTraversal', which is of type int; 'preTraversal', which is of type int.

'dfs_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dfs_DepthFirstSearch' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'postTraversalCounter', which is of type int; 'preTraversalCounter', which is of type int.

'EdgeProcessor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dfs_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'dfs_DFSGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dfs_EdgeProcessor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EdgeType' defines the following possible values: 'FORWARD_EDGE', 'BACKWARD_EDGE', 'TREE_EDGE', 'CROSS_EDGE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dfs_DepthFirstSearch' is a specialization of 'EdgeProcessor'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dfs_EdgeProcessor' and 'dfs_EdgeProcessor'. From 'dfs_EdgeProcessor', the role 'dfs_EdgeProcessor0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dfs_EdgeProcessor', the role 'dfs_EdgeProcessor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dfs_Edge' and 'dfs_Node'. From 'dfs_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dfs_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dfs_Node' and 'dfs_DFSGraph'. From 'dfs_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dfs_DFSGraph', the role 'DFSGraph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dfs_EObject' and 'dfs_Node'. From 'dfs_EObject', the role 'dfs_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dfs_Node', the role 'dfs_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dfs_Edge' and 'dfs_Node'. From 'dfs_Edge', the role 'Edge6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dfs_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dfs_DFSGraph' and 'dfs_Edge'. From 'dfs_DFSGraph', the role 'DFSGraph8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dfs_Edge', the role 'edges' has cardinality 0..*.
