The domain model 'exp' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'exp_Exp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Exp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'exp_Add' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'exp_Lit' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'exp_Lit' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'exp_Add' is a specialization of 'Exp'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'exp_Add' and 'exp_Exp'. From 'exp_Add', the role 'exp_Add' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'exp_Exp', the role 'exp_Exp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'exp_Add' and 'exp_Exp'. From 'exp_Add', the role 'exp_Add2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'exp_Exp', the role 'exp_Exp3' has cardinality 0..*.
