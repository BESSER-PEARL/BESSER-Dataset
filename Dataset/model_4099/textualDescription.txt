The domain model 'railway' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'railway_RailwayContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_SwitchPosition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'position', which is of type str.

'railway_TrackElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_Segment' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'length', which is of type int.

'railway_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_Semaphore' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'signal', which is of type str.

'TrackElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_RailwayElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: '_id', which is of type int.

'railway_Switch' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'currentPosition', which is of type str.

'RailwayElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'railway_Route' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Signal' defines the following possible values: 'GO', 'FAILURE', 'STOP'.
The enumeration 'Position' defines the following possible values: 'FAILURE', 'STRAIGHT', 'DIVERGING'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'railway_Segment' is a specialization of 'TrackElement'.
The class 'railway_TrackElement' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Switch' is a specialization of 'TrackElement'.
The class 'railway_Route' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Semaphore' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_SwitchPosition' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Sensor' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.
The class 'railway_Region' is a specialization of 'RailwayElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
