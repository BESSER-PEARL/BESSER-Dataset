Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'edgeop' defines the following possible values: 'directed', 'undirected'.
The enumeration 'graphtype' defines the following possible values: 'graph', 'digraph'.
The enumeration 'attributetype' defines the following possible values: 'node', 'edge', 'graph'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dot_edge_stmt_node' is a specialization of 'stmt'.
The class 'dot_edge_stmt_subgraph' is a specialization of 'stmt'.
The class 'dot_node_stmt' is a specialization of 'stmt'.
The class 'dot_attribute' is a specialization of 'stmt'.
The class 'dot_attr_stmt' is a specialization of 'stmt'.
The class 'dot_subgraph' is a specialization of 'stmt'.
The class 'dot_edgeRHS_node' is a specialization of 'edgeRHS'.
The class 'dot_edgeRHS_subgraph' is a specialization of 'edgeRHS'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
