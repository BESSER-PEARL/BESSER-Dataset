Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ramRoot_GenericNode' and 'ramRoot_MT__Element'. From 'ramRoot_GenericNode', the role 'ramRoot_GenericNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MT__Element', the role 'ramRoot_MT__Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpos__Classroom' and 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person'. From 'ramRoot_MTpos__Classroom', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Classroom' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person' and 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person'. From 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person' and 'ramRoot_MTpos__Classroom'. From 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Person7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpos__Classroom', the role 'ramRoot_MTpos__Classroom6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ramRoot_MTpre__Person' and 'ramRoot_MTpre__Classroom'. From 'ramRoot_MTpre__Person', the role 'ramRoot_MTpre__Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ramRoot_MTpre__Classroom', the role 'ramRoot_MTpre__Classroom' has cardinality 0..*.
