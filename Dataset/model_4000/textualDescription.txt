The domain model 'classes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'classes_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'classes_ClassDiagram' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classes_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classes_Reference' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'datetime', 'integer', 'string', 'bool', 'float'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classes_ClassDiagram' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_ClassDiagram', the role 'diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Attribute' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'cls' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Reference' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_Reference', the role 'Reference' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'cls3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_ClassDiagram' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_ClassDiagram', the role 'ClassDiagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'classes' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Attribute' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_Attribute', the role 'classes_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'classes_Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Attribute' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_Attribute', the role 'attributes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'Class7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Reference' and 'classes_Class'. From 'classes_Reference', the role 'references' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Class', the role 'Class9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classes_Class' and 'classes_Reference'. From 'classes_Class', the role 'classes_Class11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classes_Reference', the role 'classes_Reference' has cardinality 0..*.
