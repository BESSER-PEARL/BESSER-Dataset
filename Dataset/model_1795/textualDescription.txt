The domain model 'university' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'university_Module' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_Book' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'authorNames', which is of type str; 'ISBN', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_PrimitiveType' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'h', which is of type str; 'a', which is of type str; 'k', which is of type str; 'e', which is of type str; 'c', which is of type str; 'i', which is of type float; 'j', which is of type str; 'm', which is of type str; 'l', which is of type str; 'b', which is of type int; 'f', which is of type float; 'o', which is of type str; 'd', which is of type bool; 'g', which is of type str; 'n', which is of type str; 'bigIntList', which is of type str; 'p', which is of type str.

'university_University' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_Library' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_Computer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'university_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'university_Department' represents an important domain concept.

'university_Vehicle' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'registrationNumber', which is of type str.

'university_StaffMember' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'staffMemberType', which is of type str.

'university_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'studentId', which is of type float.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'StaffMemberType' defines the following possible values: 'Honary', 'Academic', 'Research', 'Technical', 'Other', 'ResearchStudent', 'Admin'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'university_University' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_Student' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_Library' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_Computer' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_Book' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_StaffMember' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_Department' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'university_Module' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'university_Department' and 'university_University'. From 'university_Department', the role 'university_Department' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_University', the role 'university_University' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Library' and 'university_University'. From 'university_Library', the role 'university_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_University', the role 'university_University2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_University' and 'university_StaffMember'. From 'university_University', the role 'university_University4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_StaffMember', the role 'university_StaffMember' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Student' and 'university_Module'. From 'university_Student', the role 'enrolledStudents' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Module', the role 'Module' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Student' and 'university_Vehicle'. From 'university_Student', the role 'university_Student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Vehicle', the role 'university_Vehicle' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Computer' and 'university_Library'. From 'university_Computer', the role 'university_Computer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Library', the role 'university_Library8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'university_Library' and 'university_Book'. From 'university_Library', the role 'university_Library10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'university_Book', the role 'university_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
