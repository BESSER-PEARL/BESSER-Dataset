The domain model 'root' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'root_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'root_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'root_A' and 'root_B'. From 'root_A', the role 'root_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'root_B', the role 'root_B' has cardinality 0..*.
