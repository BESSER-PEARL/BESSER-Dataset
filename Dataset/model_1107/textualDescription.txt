The domain model 'fsml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'fsml_FSMState' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'initial', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'fsml_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsml_FSMTransition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'input', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsml_FSMState' and 'fsml_FSM'. From 'fsml_FSMState', the role 'fsml_FSMState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsml_FSM', the role 'fsml_FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsml_FSMTransition' and 'fsml_FSMState'. From 'fsml_FSMTransition', the role 'fsml_FSMTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsml_FSMState', the role 'fsml_FSMState2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsml_FSMTransition' and 'fsml_FSMState'. From 'fsml_FSMTransition', the role 'fsml_FSMTransition4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsml_FSMState', the role 'fsml_FSMState5' has cardinality 0..*.
