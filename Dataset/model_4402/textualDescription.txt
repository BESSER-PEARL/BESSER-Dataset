The domain model 'featureModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'featureModel_RelationFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'upperBound', which is of type int; 'lowerBound', which is of type int.

'featureModel_Project' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'validatedOCL', which is of type bool; 'validatedTEF', which is of type bool; 'numberOfProducts', which is of type int; 'nameConfigFile', which is of type str; 'nameConstraintsFile', which is of type str.

'Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_TypedValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'stringValue', which is of type str; 'integerValue', which is of type str; 'floatValue', which is of type str.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_RelationFG' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_FeatureGroup' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'upperBound', which is of type int; 'lowerBound', which is of type int; 'type', which is of type str.

'featureModel_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featureModel_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'valueType', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'FeatureGroupType' defines the following possible values: 'XORGROUP', 'SIMPLEGROUP', 'ORGROUP'.
The enumeration 'ValueType' defines the following possible values: 'FEATURE', 'NONE', 'FLOAT', 'INTEGER', 'STRING'.
The enumeration 'FeatureType' defines the following possible values: 'SIMPLE', 'MANDATORY', 'OPTIONAL'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featureModel_Feature' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'featureModel_FeatureGroup' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'featureModel_RelationFG' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'featureModel_RelationFeature' is a specialization of 'Relation'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'featureModel_TypedValue' and 'featureModel_Feature'. From 'featureModel_TypedValue', the role 'featureModel_TypedValue' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Feature', the role 'featureModel_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featureModel_Feature' and 'featureModel_Node'. From 'featureModel_Feature', the role 'featureModel_Feature2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featureModel_Node', the role 'featureModel_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
