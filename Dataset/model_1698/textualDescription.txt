The domain model 'yyg' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'yyg_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyg_Rel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyg_Base' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'yyg_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'yyg_Baz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'zig', which is of type str.

'Baz' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyg_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyg_Zing' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyg_Boul' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'hi', which is of type str.

'yyg_Output' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyg_Boz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'yyg_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyg_Bouz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'bil', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'yyg_Base' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyg_Boz' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyg_Baz' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyg_Bouz' is a specialization of 'Baz'.
The class 'yyg_Boul' is a specialization of 'Baz'.
The class 'yyg_Zing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'yyg_Boz' and 'yyg_Base'. From 'yyg_Boz', the role 'Boz' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_Base', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyg_Foo' and 'yyg_Base'. From 'yyg_Foo', the role 'yyg_Foo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_Base', the role 'yyg_Base' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyg_Base' and 'yyg_Output'. From 'yyg_Base', the role 'yyg_Base3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_Output', the role 'yyg_Output' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyg_Baz' and 'yyg_Base'. From 'yyg_Baz', the role 'yyg_Baz' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_Base', the role 'yyg_Base5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyg_Alias' and 'yyg_NamedElement'. From 'yyg_Alias', the role 'yyg_Alias' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_NamedElement', the role 'yyg_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyg_NamedElement' and 'yyg_Bar'. From 'yyg_NamedElement', the role 'yyg_NamedElement8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_Bar', the role 'yyg_Bar' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyg_Rel' and 'yyg_NamedElement'. From 'yyg_Rel', the role 'yyg_Rel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyg_NamedElement', the role 'yyg_NamedElement10' has cardinality 0..*.
