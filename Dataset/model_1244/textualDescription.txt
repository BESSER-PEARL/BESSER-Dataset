Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'LogExp' and 'ImperativeOCL_AssertExp'. From 'LogExp', the role 'LogExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ImperativeOCL_AssertExp', the role 'ImperativeOCL_AssertExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DictLiteralPart' and 'ImperativeOCL_DictLiteralExp'. From 'DictLiteralPart', the role 'DictLiteralPart' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ImperativeOCL_DictLiteralExp', the role 'ImperativeOCL_DictLiteralExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ImperativeOCL_OrderedTupleLiteralExp' and 'OrderedTupleLiteralPart'. From 'ImperativeOCL_OrderedTupleLiteralExp', the role 'ImperativeOCL_OrderedTupleLiteralExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OrderedTupleLiteralPart', the role 'OrderedTupleLiteralPart' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ImperativeOCL_SwitchExp' and 'AltExp'. From 'ImperativeOCL_SwitchExp', the role 'ImperativeOCL_SwitchExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'AltExp', the role 'AltExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ImperativeOCL_TryExp' and 'CatchExp'. From 'ImperativeOCL_TryExp', the role 'ImperativeOCL_TryExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'CatchExp', the role 'CatchExp' has cardinality 0..*.
