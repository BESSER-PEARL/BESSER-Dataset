The domain model 'forms' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'forms_Choice' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'multiple', which is of type bool.

'forms_FreeText' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_Date' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_Form' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'caption', which is of type str.

'forms_Group' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'forms_Option' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'text', which is of type str.

'forms_Item' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'explanation', which is of type str; 'text', which is of type str.

'forms_Decision' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_Number' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ItemType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forms_ItemType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'forms_FreeText' is a specialization of 'ItemType'.
The class 'forms_Choice' is a specialization of 'ItemType'.
The class 'forms_Date' is a specialization of 'ItemType'.
The class 'forms_Number' is a specialization of 'ItemType'.
The class 'forms_Decision' is a specialization of 'ItemType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'forms_Form' and 'forms_Group'. From 'forms_Form', the role 'forms_Form' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Group', the role 'forms_Group' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_ItemType' and 'forms_Item'. From 'forms_ItemType', the role 'forms_ItemType' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Item', the role 'forms_Item' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_Option' and 'forms_Item'. From 'forms_Option', the role 'forms_Option' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Item', the role 'forms_Item3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_Option' and 'forms_Choice'. From 'forms_Option', the role 'forms_Option5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Choice', the role 'forms_Choice' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_Item' and 'forms_Group'. From 'forms_Item', the role 'forms_Item8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Group', the role 'forms_Group7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'forms_Decision' and 'forms_Option'. From 'forms_Decision', the role 'forms_Decision' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'forms_Option', the role 'forms_Option10' has cardinality 0..*.
