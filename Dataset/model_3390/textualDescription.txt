The domain model 'DML' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'DML_InsertInto' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tableName', which is of type str.

'DML_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'columnName', which is of type str.

'DML_Registry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'DML_Value' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'DML_InsertsStatements' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'DML_InsertsStatements' and 'DML_InsertInto'. From 'DML_InsertsStatements', the role 'DML_InsertsStatements' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DML_InsertInto', the role 'DML_InsertInto' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DML_InsertInto' and 'DML_Registry'. From 'DML_InsertInto', the role 'DML_InsertInto2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DML_Registry', the role 'DML_Registry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DML_InsertInto' and 'DML_Column'. From 'DML_InsertInto', the role 'DML_InsertInto4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DML_Column', the role 'DML_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DML_Registry' and 'DML_Value'. From 'DML_Registry', the role 'DML_Registry6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DML_Value', the role 'DML_Value' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DML_Value' and 'DML_Column'. From 'DML_Value', the role 'DML_Value8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DML_Column', the role 'DML_Column9' has cardinality 0..*.
