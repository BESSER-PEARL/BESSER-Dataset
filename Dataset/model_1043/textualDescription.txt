The domain model 'MetaModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'MetaModel_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'cost', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'time', which is of type str.

'MetaModel_IntermidiateState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MetaModel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'description', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'MetaModel_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MetaModel_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MetaModel_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'MetaModel_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'MetaModel_IntermidiateState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'MetaModel_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'MetaModel_Transition' and 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle'. From 'MetaModel_Transition', the role 'MetaModel_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle', the role 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle' and 'MetaModel_InitialState'. From 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle', the role 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetaModel_InitialState', the role 'MetaModel_InitialState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle' and 'MetaModel_IntermidiateState'. From 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle', the role 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetaModel_IntermidiateState', the role 'MetaModel_IntermidiateState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle' and 'MetaModel_FinalState'. From 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle', the role 'MetaModel_EvolutionStyle6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetaModel_FinalState', the role 'MetaModel_FinalState' has cardinality 0..*.
