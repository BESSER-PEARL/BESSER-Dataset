The domain model 'pghttptest' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'pghttptest_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'priv1', which is of type int.

'pghttptest_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pghttptest_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'pghttptest_Priv' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pghttptest_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pghttptest_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pghttptest_D' is a specialization of 'C'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pghttptest_Root' and 'pghttptest_A'. From 'pghttptest_Root', the role 'pghttptest_Root' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pghttptest_A', the role 'pghttptest_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pghttptest_Root' and 'pghttptest_B'. From 'pghttptest_Root', the role 'pghttptest_Root2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pghttptest_B', the role 'pghttptest_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pghttptest_B' and 'pghttptest_C'. From 'pghttptest_B', the role 'pghttptest_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pghttptest_C', the role 'pghttptest_C' has cardinality 0..*.
