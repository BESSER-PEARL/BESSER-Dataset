The domain model 'ABC' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'ABC_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ABC_A' and 'ABC_B'. From 'ABC_A', the role 'ABC_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ABC_B', the role 'ABC_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ABC_C' and 'ABC_A'. From 'ABC_C', the role 'ABC_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ABC_A', the role 'ABC_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ABC_D' and 'ABC_B'. From 'ABC_D', the role 'ABC_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ABC_B', the role 'ABC_B4' has cardinality 0..*.
