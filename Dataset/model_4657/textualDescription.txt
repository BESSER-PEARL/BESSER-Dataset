The domain model 'di' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 17 main class(es).

'di_LabeledShape' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'di_Node' is a specialization of 'DiagramElement'.
The class 'di_Edge' is a specialization of 'DiagramElement'.
The class 'di_Shape' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'di_LabeledEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.
The class 'di_Label' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'di_LabeledShape' is a specialization of 'Shape'.
The class 'di_Plane' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'di_DiagramElement' and 'di_Diagram'. From 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'rootElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_Diagram', the role 'Diagram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'di_DiagramElement' and 'di_DiagramElement'. From 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'ownedElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'di_DiagramElement', the role 'DiagramElement' has cardinality 0..*.
