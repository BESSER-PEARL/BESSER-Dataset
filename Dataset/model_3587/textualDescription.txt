The domain model 'TypeA' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'TypeA_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameA', which is of type str.

'TypeA_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nameB', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TypeA_A' and 'TypeA_B'. From 'TypeA_A', the role 'TypeA_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeA_B', the role 'TypeA_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TypeA_B' and 'TypeA_A'. From 'TypeA_B', the role 'TypeA_B2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeA_A', the role 'TypeA_A3' has cardinality 0..*.
