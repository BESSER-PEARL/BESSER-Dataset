The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'UML2_Stereotype' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'UML2_ProtocolStateMachine' is a specialization of 'StateMachine'.
The class 'UML2_Interaction' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'UML2_Node' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'UML2_Activity' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'UML2_Component' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'UML2_ExecutionEnvironment' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'UML2_Behavior' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'UML2_AssociationClass' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'UML2_Device' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'UML2_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'UML2_Collaboration' is a specialization of 'BehavioredClassifier'.
The class 'UML2_Operation' is a specialization of 'BehavioralFeature'.
The class 'UML2_UseCase' is a specialization of 'BehavioredClassifier'.
The class 'UML2_Class' is a specialization of 'BehavioredClassifier'.
The class 'UML2_Reception' is a specialization of 'BehavioralFeature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UML2_Behavior' and 'UML2_BehavioralFeature'. From 'UML2_Behavior', the role 'UML2_Behavior' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_BehavioralFeature', the role 'UML2_BehavioralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_Behavior' and 'UML2_BehavioredClassifier'. From 'UML2_Behavior', the role 'UML2_Behavior2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_BehavioredClassifier', the role 'UML2_BehavioredClassifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_BehavioredClassifier' and 'UML2_Behavior'. From 'UML2_BehavioredClassifier', the role 'UML2_BehavioredClassifier4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_Behavior', the role 'UML2_Behavior5' has cardinality 0..*.
