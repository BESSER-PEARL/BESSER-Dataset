The model defines 6 main class(es).

'study_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'study_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'credits', which is of type float; 'code', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'level', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Season' defines the following possible values: 'FALL', 'SPRING'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
