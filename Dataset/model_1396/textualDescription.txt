The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Signal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Signal' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_InputSignal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newValue', which is of type bool.

'statemachine_OutputSignal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type bool.

'statemachine_Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statemachine_InputSignal' is a specialization of 'Signal'.
The class 'statemachine_OutputSignal' is a specialization of 'Signal'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine_Signal' and 'statemachine_Statemachine'. From 'statemachine_Signal', the role 'statemachine_Signal' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Statemachine', the role 'statemachine_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Statemachine' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Statemachine', the role 'statemachine_Statemachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Command'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Command', the role 'statemachine_Command' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_Condition'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Condition', the role 'statemachine_Condition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Transition' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Event' and 'statemachine_Condition'. From 'statemachine_Event', the role 'statemachine_Event' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Condition', the role 'statemachine_Condition16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Signal' and 'statemachine_Event'. From 'statemachine_Signal', the role 'statemachine_Signal19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Event', the role 'statemachine_Event18' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Command' and 'statemachine_Signal'. From 'statemachine_Command', the role 'statemachine_Command21' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Signal', the role 'statemachine_Signal22' has cardinality 0..*.
