The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_SM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'statemachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_SM'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_SM', the role 'statemachine_SM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_SM' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_SM', the role 'statemachine_SM2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_SM' and 'statemachine_State'. From 'statemachine_SM', the role 'statemachine_SM5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_SM' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_SM', the role 'statemachine_SM8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Event' and 'statemachine_SM'. From 'statemachine_Event', the role 'statemachine_Event' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_SM', the role 'statemachine_SM10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_State' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_State', the role 'statemachine_State16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachine_Event' and 'statemachine_Transition'. From 'statemachine_Event', the role 'statemachine_Event19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachine_Transition', the role 'statemachine_Transition18' has cardinality 0..*.
