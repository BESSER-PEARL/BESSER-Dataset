The domain model 'merge' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'merge_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'merge_Clazz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'attribute', which is of type float.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'merge_EObject' and 'merge_Clazz'. From 'merge_EObject', the role 'merge_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'merge_Clazz', the role 'merge_Clazz' has cardinality 0..*.
