Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MessageEventKind' defines the following possible values: 'TRANSMITTED', 'ERROR', 'RECEIVED', 'INSTANTIATED'.
The enumeration 'SliceKind' defines the following possible values: 'FUNCTION_INSTANCE', 'TASK', 'FRAME', 'LINK', 'STATE', 'PACKET', 'OS', 'RESOURCE', 'TEMPORAL_CHAIN', 'JOB', 'AUTOMATON', 'OTHER', 'FUNCTION'.
The enumeration 'SchedulingEventKind' defines the following possible values: 'BLOCKED', 'SUSPENDED', 'TERMINATED', 'ACTIVATED', 'RUNNING', 'DEADLINE'.
The enumeration 'ResourceEventKind' defines the following possible values: 'ACQUIRED', 'RELEASED', 'REQUESTED'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trace_Trace' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'trace_Event' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'trace_ResourceEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'trace_SchedulingEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'trace_MessageEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'trace_Slice' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'trace_Properties' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'trace_ValueChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'trace_ObjectValueChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'ValueChangeEvent'.
The class 'trace_DurationValueChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'ValueChangeEvent'.
The class 'trace_DataSizeValueChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'ValueChangeEvent'.
The class 'trace_NumberValueChangeEvent' is a specialization of 'ValueChangeEvent'.
