The domain model 'turingmodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'turingmodel_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'isEndState', which is of type bool.

'turingmodel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'condition', which is of type str; 'write', which is of type str; 'dir', which is of type str.

'turingmodel_TuringMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Direction' defines the following possible values: 'HOLD', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'turingmodel_State' and 'turingmodel_TuringMachine'. From 'turingmodel_State', the role 'turingmodel_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'turingmodel_TuringMachine', the role 'turingmodel_TuringMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'turingmodel_Transition' and 'turingmodel_TuringMachine'. From 'turingmodel_Transition', the role 'turingmodel_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'turingmodel_TuringMachine', the role 'turingmodel_TuringMachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'turingmodel_TuringMachine' and 'turingmodel_State'. From 'turingmodel_TuringMachine', the role 'turingmodel_TuringMachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'turingmodel_State', the role 'turingmodel_State5' has cardinality 0..*.
