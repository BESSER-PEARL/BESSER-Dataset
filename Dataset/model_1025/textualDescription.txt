The domain model 'nicoLang' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'nicoLang_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'nicoLang_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'trigger', which is of type str.

'nicoLang_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'nicoLang_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nicoLang_InitState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'nicoLang_InitState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'nicoLang_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'nicoLang_Transition' and 'nicoLang_FSM'. From 'nicoLang_Transition', the role 'nicoLang_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nicoLang_FSM', the role 'nicoLang_FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nicoLang_State' and 'nicoLang_FSM'. From 'nicoLang_State', the role 'nicoLang_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nicoLang_FSM', the role 'nicoLang_FSM2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nicoLang_Transition' and 'nicoLang_State'. From 'nicoLang_Transition', the role 'nicoLang_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nicoLang_State', the role 'nicoLang_State5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'nicoLang_Transition' and 'nicoLang_State'. From 'nicoLang_Transition', the role 'nicoLang_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'nicoLang_State', the role 'nicoLang_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
