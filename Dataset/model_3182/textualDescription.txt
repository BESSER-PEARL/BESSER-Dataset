The domain model 'architecture' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'architecture_Architecture' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'architecture_Import' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'importedNamespace', which is of type str.

'architecture_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'architecture_AtomicType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'atomType', which is of type str.

'architecture_AbstractModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'architecture_DomainDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'architecture_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'architecture_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'architecture_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'architecture_Binding' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'Boolean', 'INT', 'STRING', 'Void', 'Double'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
