The domain model 'minimalref' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'minimalref_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'minimalref_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'minimalref_B' and 'minimalref_A'. From 'minimalref_B', the role 'B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minimalref_A', the role 'parentA' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'minimalref_B' and 'minimalref_A'. From 'minimalref_B', the role 'manyB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'minimalref_A', the role 'A' has cardinality 0..*.
