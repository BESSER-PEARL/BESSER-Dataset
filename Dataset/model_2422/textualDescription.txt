The domain model 'Relational' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'Relational_FKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Relational_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Relational_Named' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Relational_ERModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Relational_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Relational_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Relational_Table' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'Relational_Column' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'Relational_Type' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Relational_Table' and 'Relational_Column'. From 'Relational_Table', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Column' and 'Relational_Table'. From 'Relational_Column', the role 'Column2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Table', the role 'keyOf' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Table' and 'Relational_FKey'. From 'Relational_Table', the role 'Relational_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_FKey', the role 'Relational_FKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Table' and 'Relational_Column'. From 'Relational_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Column', the role 'col' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Column' and 'Relational_Table'. From 'Relational_Column', the role 'key' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Table', the role 'Table6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Column' and 'Relational_Type'. From 'Relational_Column', the role 'Relational_Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Type', the role 'Relational_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_FKey' and 'Relational_Table'. From 'Relational_FKey', the role 'Relational_FKey9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Table', the role 'Relational_Table10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Column' and 'Relational_FKey'. From 'Relational_Column', the role 'Relational_Column13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_FKey', the role 'Relational_FKey12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_ERModel' and 'Relational_Table'. From 'Relational_ERModel', the role 'Relational_ERModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_Table', the role 'Relational_Table15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Relational_Type' and 'Relational_ERModel'. From 'Relational_Type', the role 'Relational_Type18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Relational_ERModel', the role 'Relational_ERModel17' has cardinality 0..*.
