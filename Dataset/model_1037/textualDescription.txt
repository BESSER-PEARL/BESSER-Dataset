The class 'tfsm_UpperEqualClockConstraint' is a specialization of 'ClockConstraint'.
The class 'tfsm_AndClockConstraint' is a specialization of 'BinaryClockConstraint'.
The class 'tfsm_OrClockConstraint' is a specialization of 'BinaryClockConstraint'.
The class 'tfsm_BinaryClockConstraint' is a specialization of 'ClockConstraintOperation'.
The class 'tfsm_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'tfsm_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
