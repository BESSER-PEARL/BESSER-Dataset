The domain model 'Class' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'Class_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'derive', which is of type bool; 'id', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'Class_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Class_Class' and 'Class_Attribute'. From 'Class_Class', the role 'type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Class_Attribute', the role 'Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
