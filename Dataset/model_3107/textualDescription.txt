The domain model 'uml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'uml_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'uml_UMLSpecification' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'uml_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'uml_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'uml_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'uml_Association' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'uml_UMLSpecification' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'uml_Class' and 'uml_Association'. From 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Association', the role 'uml_Association' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Association' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_Association', the role 'uml_Association2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Class' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Attribute' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_Attribute', the role 'uml_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Class' and 'uml_Attribute'. From 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Attribute', the role 'uml_Attribute10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_UMLSpecification' and 'uml_Class'. From 'uml_UMLSpecification', the role 'uml_UMLSpecification' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_Class', the role 'uml_Class13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uml_Association' and 'uml_UMLSpecification'. From 'uml_Association', the role 'uml_Association16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uml_UMLSpecification', the role 'uml_UMLSpecification15' has cardinality 0..*.
