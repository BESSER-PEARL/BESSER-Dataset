The domain model 'B' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'B_Any' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B_Machine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'B_Begin' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'B_Skip' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B_SET' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'B_VariableList' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'size', which is of type str.

'B_Predicate' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'expression', which is of type str.

'B_If' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'B_Predicate' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'B_Any' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'B_Action' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'B_If' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'B_Skip' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'B_Begin' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
