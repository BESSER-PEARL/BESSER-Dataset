The domain model 'mongoQuery' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'mongoQuery_Selection' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mongoQuery_Array' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mongoQuery_Query' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'stringValue', which is of type str; 'key', which is of type str; 'numberValue', which is of type float; 'integerValue', which is of type int.

'Query' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mongoQuery_Selector' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mongoQuery_QueryObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mongoQuery_FieldSelection' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'key', which is of type str; 'enabled', which is of type int.

'mongoQuery_JsonDate' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'hour', which is of type int; 'milliseconds', which is of type int; 'day', which is of type int; 'year', which is of type int; 'month', which is of type int; 'millisecond', which is of type int; 'dateString', which is of type str; 'second', which is of type int; 'minute', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mongoQuery_QueryObject' is a specialization of 'Query'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mongoQuery_Selector' and 'mongoQuery_Query'. From 'mongoQuery_Selector', the role 'mongoQuery_Selector' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mongoQuery_Query', the role 'mongoQuery_Query' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mongoQuery_Selector' and 'mongoQuery_Selection'. From 'mongoQuery_Selector', the role 'mongoQuery_Selector2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mongoQuery_Selection', the role 'mongoQuery_Selection' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mongoQuery_Selection' and 'mongoQuery_FieldSelection'. From 'mongoQuery_Selection', the role 'mongoQuery_Selection4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mongoQuery_FieldSelection', the role 'mongoQuery_FieldSelection' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mongoQuery_Query' and 'mongoQuery_Query'. From 'mongoQuery_Query', the role 'mongoQuery_Query7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mongoQuery_Query', the role 'mongoQuery_Query5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mongoQuery_JsonDate' and 'mongoQuery_Query'. From 'mongoQuery_JsonDate', the role 'mongoQuery_JsonDate' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mongoQuery_Query', the role 'mongoQuery_Query9' has cardinality 0..*.
