The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'trace_EStructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EPackage' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_ClassMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_EAttribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_Trace' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_ReferenceMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'trace_EReference' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'trace_AttributeMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ReferenceMappingType' defines the following possible values: 'MAPPED', 'NONE', 'TRANSLATED'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
