The domain model 'stateMachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'stateMachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_Role' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_FieldState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'state', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'package', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_Trans' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'stateMachine_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_DocumentField' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'stateMachine_TransSet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EFieldState' defines the following possible values: 'READONLY', 'EDITABLE', 'HIDDEN'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'stateMachine_StateMachine' and 'stateMachine_Event'. From 'stateMachine_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_Event', the role 'stateMachine_Event' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'stateMachine_StateMachine' and 'stateMachine_State'. From 'stateMachine_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'stateMachine_State', the role 'stateMachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
