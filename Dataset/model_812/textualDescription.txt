The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'fsm_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'unprocessedString', which is of type str; 'consummedString', which is of type str; 'producedString', which is of type str.

'fsm_FSMSystem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Buffer' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'currentValues', which is of type str; 'initialValue', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'input', which is of type str; 'output', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_FSMSystem' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_Buffer' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_StateMachine' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_StateMachine' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'fsm_StateMachine6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
