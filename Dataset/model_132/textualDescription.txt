The domain model 'JAVA' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 19 main class(es).

'JAVA_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'JAVA_InterfaceDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BodyDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'JAVA_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'JAVA_FieldDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'JAVA_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'JAVA_BodyDeclaration' represents an important domain concept.

'JAVA_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'proxy', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration' is a specialization of 'TypeDeclaration'.
The class 'JAVA_TypeAccess' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'JAVA_InterfaceDeclaration' is a specialization of 'TypeDeclaration'.
The class 'JAVA_Package' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration' is a specialization of 'BodyDeclaration'.
The class 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'JAVA_Type' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'JAVA_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'ASTNode'.
The class 'JAVA_TypeDeclaration' is a specialization of 'AbstractTypeDeclaration'.
The class 'JAVA_BodyDeclaration' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'JAVA_Expression' is a specialization of 'ASTNode'.
The class 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration' is a specialization of 'BodyDeclaration'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'JAVA_TypeAccess' and 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration'. From 'JAVA_TypeAccess', the role 'JAVA_TypeAccess' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration' and 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration'. From 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_ClassDeclaration2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JAVA_TypeDeclaration' and 'JAVA_TypeAccess'. From 'JAVA_TypeDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_TypeDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JAVA_TypeAccess', the role 'JAVA_TypeAccess4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration' and 'JAVA_Package'. From 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JAVA_Package', the role 'JAVA_Package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration' and 'JAVA_TypeAccess'. From 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_AbstractTypeDeclaration7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JAVA_TypeAccess', the role 'JAVA_TypeAccess8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JAVA_TypeAccess' and 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration'. From 'JAVA_TypeAccess', the role 'JAVA_TypeAccess11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration', the role 'JAVA_FieldDeclaration10' has cardinality 0..*.
