The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'graph_Mark' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'time', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Mark'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Mark', the role 'Mark' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Mark'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Mark', the role 'Mark6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Node'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Node', the role 'graph_Node11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Edge' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_Edge', the role 'edges' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'Graph13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Node' and 'graph_Mark'. From 'graph_Node', the role 'Node15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Mark', the role 'mark' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Mark' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_Mark', the role 'marks' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'Graph17' has cardinality 0..*.
