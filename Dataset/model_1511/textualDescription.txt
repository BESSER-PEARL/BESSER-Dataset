The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'model_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'trigger', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'model_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'model_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_State' and 'model_FSM'. From 'model_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_FSM', the role 'fsm' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_FSM' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_FSM', the role 'fsm2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_State' and 'model_FSM'. From 'model_State', the role 'model_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_FSM', the role 'model_FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_State' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_State', the role 'tgt' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role 'Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Transition' and 'model_State'. From 'model_Transition', the role 'Transition7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_State', the role 'src' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_State' and 'model_FSM'. From 'model_State', the role 'ownedStates' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_FSM', the role 'FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_State' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_State', the role 'State10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_State' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_State', the role 'State12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_FSM' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_FSM', the role 'FSM14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role 'ownedTransitions' has cardinality 0..*.
