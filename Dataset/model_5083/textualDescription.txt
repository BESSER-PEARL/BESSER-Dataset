The domain model 'adlold' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'adlold_Binding' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlold_Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'signature', which is of type str.

'adlold_Required' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlold_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractComponent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlold_AbstractComponent' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'adlold_Content' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'expression', which is of type str; 'language', which is of type str.

'adlold_Provided' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'adlold_Required' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adlold_Provided' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adlold_Component' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'adlold_AbstractComponent' and 'adlold_Content'. From 'adlold_AbstractComponent', the role 'adlold_AbstractComponent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Content', the role 'adlold_Content' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_AbstractComponent' and 'adlold_Required'. From 'adlold_AbstractComponent', the role 'adlold_AbstractComponent2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Required', the role 'adlold_Required' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_AbstractComponent' and 'adlold_Provided'. From 'adlold_AbstractComponent', the role 'adlold_AbstractComponent4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Provided', the role 'adlold_Provided' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_Binding' and 'adlold_Interface'. From 'adlold_Binding', the role 'adlold_Binding' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Interface', the role 'adlold_Interface' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_Interface' and 'adlold_Binding'. From 'adlold_Interface', the role 'adlold_Interface8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Binding', the role 'adlold_Binding7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_Binding' and 'adlold_Interface'. From 'adlold_Binding', the role 'adlold_Binding10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Interface', the role 'adlold_Interface11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_AbstractComponent' and 'adlold_Content'. From 'adlold_AbstractComponent', the role 'adlold_AbstractComponent14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Content', the role 'adlold_Content13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlold_Component' and 'adlold_Component'. From 'adlold_Component', the role 'adlold_Component' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlold_Component', the role 'adlold_Component15' has cardinality 0..*.
