The domain model 'automaticexperiment' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'referanceDataDir', which is of type str; 'reInit', which is of type bool; 'maximumNumberOfIterations', which is of type str; 'errorAnalysisAlgorithm', which is of type str; 'errorFunction', which is of type str; 'tolerance', which is of type float.

'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'targetURI', which is of type str; 'step', which is of type float; 'lowerBound', which is of type float; 'featureName', which is of type str; 'upperBound', which is of type float; 'initialValue', which is of type float.

'Identifiable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'automaticexperiment_Scenario' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'automaticexperiment_EStructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment' is a specialization of 'Identifiable'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'automaticexperiment_Scenario' and 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment'. From 'automaticexperiment_Scenario', the role 'automaticexperiment_Scenario' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment', the role 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter' and 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment'. From 'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter', the role 'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment', the role 'automaticexperiment_AutomaticExperiment2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter' and 'automaticexperiment_EStructuralFeature'. From 'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter', the role 'automaticexperiment_ModifiableParameter4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automaticexperiment_EStructuralFeature', the role 'automaticexperiment_EStructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
