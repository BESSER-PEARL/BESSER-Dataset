The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Initial' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'event', which is of type str.

'fsm_Final' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_Initial' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_Final' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'fsm_Transition5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role 'transitions' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role 'FSM' has cardinality 0..*.
