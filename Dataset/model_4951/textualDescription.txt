Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AttributePrimitiveValue' defines the following possible values: 'short', 'float', 'boolean', 'int', 'char', 'String', 'long'.
The enumeration 'CRUDOperation' defines the following possible values: 'delete', 'update', 'retrieve', 'create'.
The enumeration 'CommandType' defines the following possible values: 'compensate', 'invoke', 'reply'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
