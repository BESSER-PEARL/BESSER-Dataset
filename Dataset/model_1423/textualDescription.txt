The domain model 'statemachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'statemachine_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Value' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_ConstantRef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachine_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type int.

'statemachine_Constant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachine_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type int.

'statemachine_RangeGuard' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'statemachine_ValueGuard' is a specialization of 'Guard'.
The class 'statemachine_RangeGuard' is a specialization of 'Guard'.
The class 'statemachine_ConstantRef' is a specialization of 'Value'.
The class 'statemachine_IntLiteral' is a specialization of 'Value'.
