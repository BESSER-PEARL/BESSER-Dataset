Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DigitalSignalEnum' defines the following possible values: 'LOW', 'HIGH'.
The enumeration 'Operator' defines the following possible values: 'NONE', 'OR', 'AND'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'arduinoML_Brick' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_Condition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_LCDScreenActuator' is a specialization of 'Actuator'.
The class 'arduinoML_DigitalSignal' is a specialization of 'Signal'.
The class 'arduinoML_StringSignal' is a specialization of 'Signal'.
The class 'arduinoML_KeyboardSensor' is a specialization of 'Sensor'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'arduinoML_App' and 'arduinoML_Brick'. From 'arduinoML_App', the role 'arduinoML_App' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_Brick', the role 'arduinoML_Brick' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_State' and 'arduinoML_App'. From 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_App', the role 'arduinoML_App2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_State' and 'arduinoML_App'. From 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_App', the role 'arduinoML_App4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_State' and 'arduinoML_Action'. From 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_Action', the role 'arduinoML_Action' has cardinality 0..*.
