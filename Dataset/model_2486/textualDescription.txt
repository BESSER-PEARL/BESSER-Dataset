The domain model 'z4fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'z4fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'z4fsm_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'z4fsm_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'z4fsm_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'z4fsm_Region' and 'z4fsm_AbstractState'. From 'z4fsm_Region', the role 'z4fsm_Region' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'z4fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z4fsm_AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'z4fsm_State' and 'z4fsm_AbstractState'. From 'z4fsm_State', the role 'z4fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'z4fsm_AbstractState', the role 'z4fsm_AbstractState2' has cardinality 0..*.
