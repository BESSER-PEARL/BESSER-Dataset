Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'InheritanceKind' defines the following possible values: 'final', 'abstract', 'none'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'JMM_Package' and 'JMM_Model'. From 'JMM_Package', the role 'JMM_Package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_Model', the role 'JMM_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_TypeAccess' and 'JMM_ClassDeclaration'. From 'JMM_TypeAccess', the role 'JMM_TypeAccess' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_ClassDeclaration', the role 'JMM_ClassDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_Type' and 'JMM_TypeAccess'. From 'JMM_Type', the role 'JMM_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_TypeAccess', the role 'JMM_TypeAccess3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_Package' and 'JMM_Package'. From 'JMM_Package', the role 'JMM_Package4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_Package', the role 'JMM_Package6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration' and 'JMM_Package'. From 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration', the role 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_Package', the role 'JMM_Package8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration' and 'JMM_BodyDeclaration'. From 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration', the role 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_BodyDeclaration', the role 'JMM_BodyDeclaration' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_TypeAccess' and 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration'. From 'JMM_TypeAccess', the role 'JMM_TypeAccess13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration', the role 'JMM_AbstractTypeDeclaration12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'JMM_BodyDeclaration' and 'JMM_Modifier'. From 'JMM_BodyDeclaration', the role 'JMM_BodyDeclaration15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'JMM_Modifier', the role 'JMM_Modifier' has cardinality 0..*.
