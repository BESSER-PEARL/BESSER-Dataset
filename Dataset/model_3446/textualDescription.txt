Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'classmate_Student' and 'classmate_Classroom'. From 'classmate_Student', the role 'classmate_Student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classmate_Classroom', the role 'classmate_Classroom' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classmate_School' and 'classmate_ClassmateSystem'. From 'classmate_School', the role 'classmate_School' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classmate_ClassmateSystem', the role 'classmate_ClassmateSystem' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classmate_Friend' and 'classmate_ClassmateSystem'. From 'classmate_Friend', the role 'classmate_Friend' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classmate_ClassmateSystem', the role 'classmate_ClassmateSystem3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classmate_Classroom' and 'classmate_School'. From 'classmate_Classroom', the role 'classmate_Classroom6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classmate_School', the role 'classmate_School5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classmate_Student' and 'classmate_Friend'. From 'classmate_Student', the role 'classmate_Student9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classmate_Friend', the role 'classmate_Friend8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'classmate_Friend' and 'classmate_Student'. From 'classmate_Friend', the role 'classmate_Friend11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'classmate_Student', the role 'classmate_Student12' has cardinality 0..*.
