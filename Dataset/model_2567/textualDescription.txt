The domain model 'TestPackage' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_AbstractTestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TestPackage_TestIndex' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractTestClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TestPackage_TestClass1' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'theAttributeToListen', which is of type str.

'TestPackage_TestClass2' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'TestPackage_TestClass1' is a specialization of 'AbstractTestClass'.
The class 'TestPackage_TestClass2' is a specialization of 'AbstractTestClass'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry' and 'TestPackage_TestIndex'. From 'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry', the role 'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TestPackage_TestIndex', the role 'TestPackage_TestIndex' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TestPackage_AbstractTestClass' and 'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry'. From 'TestPackage_AbstractTestClass', the role 'TestPackage_AbstractTestClass' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry', the role 'TestPackage_TestIndexEntry2' has cardinality 0..*.
