The domain model 'introduction' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'introduction_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'test', which is of type int.

'introduction_X' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'introduction_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'introduction_con' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'introduction_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'introduction_B' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'introduction_A' and 'introduction_X'. From 'introduction_A', the role 'introduction_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'introduction_X', the role 'introduction_X' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'introduction_A' and 'introduction_Y'. From 'introduction_A', the role 'introduction_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'introduction_Y', the role 'introduction_Y' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'introduction_con' and 'introduction_A'. From 'introduction_con', the role 'introduction_con' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'introduction_A', the role 'introduction_A4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'introduction_Y' and 'introduction_con'. From 'introduction_Y', the role 'introduction_Y7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'introduction_con', the role 'introduction_con6' has cardinality 0..*.
