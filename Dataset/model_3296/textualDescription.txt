The domain model 'forcing' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'forcing_GaussianForcingDiseaseModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'sigma2', which is of type float; 'modulationFloor', which is of type float; 'modulationPhaseShift', which is of type float; 'modulationPeriod', which is of type float.

'Gaussian2ForcingDiseaseModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'forcing_Gaussian3ForcingDiseaseModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'transmissionRate3', which is of type float; 'transmissionRate2', which is of type float; 'sigma2_3', which is of type float; 'modulationFloor_2', which is of type float.

'StochasticSIRDiseaseModel' represents an important domain concept.
