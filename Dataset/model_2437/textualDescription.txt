The domain model 'sql' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'sql_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'sql_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'isNotNull', which is of type bool; 'type', which is of type str.

'sql_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sql_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sql_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sql_Database' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sql_PrimaryKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DataType' defines the following possible values: 'INT', 'VARCHAR255'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sql_Database' and 'sql_Model'. From 'sql_Database', the role 'sql_Database' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_Model', the role 'sql_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sql_Table' and 'sql_Database'. From 'sql_Table', the role 'sql_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_Database', the role 'sql_Database2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sql_EObject' and 'sql_Table'. From 'sql_EObject', the role 'sql_EObject' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_Table', the role 'sql_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sql_PrimaryKey' and 'sql_Column'. From 'sql_PrimaryKey', the role 'sql_PrimaryKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_Column', the role 'sql_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sql_Column' and 'sql_ForeignKey'. From 'sql_Column', the role 'sql_Column7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_ForeignKey', the role 'sql_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sql_ForeignKey' and 'sql_Table'. From 'sql_ForeignKey', the role 'sql_ForeignKey9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_Table', the role 'sql_Table10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sql_Column' and 'sql_ForeignKey'. From 'sql_Column', the role 'sql_Column13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sql_ForeignKey', the role 'sql_ForeignKey12' has cardinality 0..*.
