The domain model 'trace' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'trace_DebugLocationData' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'endOffset', which is of type int; 'lineNumber', which is of type int; 'endLineNumber', which is of type int; 'label', which is of type str; 'offset', which is of type int; 'path', which is of type str; 'length', which is of type int.

'trace_DebugTraceRegion' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'useForDebugging', which is of type bool; 'myEndLineNumber', which is of type int; 'myEndOffset', which is of type int; 'label', which is of type str; 'myLength', which is of type int; 'myOffset', which is of type int; 'myLineNumber', which is of type int.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trace_DebugTraceRegion' and 'trace_DebugTraceRegion'. From 'trace_DebugTraceRegion', the role 'trace_DebugTraceRegion' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trace_DebugTraceRegion', the role 'trace_DebugTraceRegion0' has cardinality 0..*.
