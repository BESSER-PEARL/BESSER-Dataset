Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'lab1_State' and 'lab1_StateMachine'. From 'lab1_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lab1_StateMachine', the role 'fsm' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lab1_StateMachine' and 'lab1_Transition'. From 'lab1_StateMachine', the role 'lab1_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lab1_Transition', the role 'lab1_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lab1_Transition' and 'lab1_State'. From 'lab1_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lab1_State', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lab1_State' and 'lab1_Transition'. From 'lab1_State', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lab1_Transition', the role 'Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lab1_StateMachine' and 'lab1_State'. From 'lab1_StateMachine', the role 'StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lab1_State', the role 'states' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lab1_State' and 'lab1_Transition'. From 'lab1_State', the role 'State7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lab1_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
