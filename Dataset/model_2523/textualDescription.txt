The domain model 'LHS' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'LHS_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'LHS_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'LHS_D' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'LHS_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'LHS_B' and 'LHS_A'. From 'LHS_B', the role 'LHS_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LHS_A', the role 'LHS_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'LHS_A' and 'LHS_C'. From 'LHS_A', the role 'LHS_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LHS_C', the role 'LHS_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'LHS_D' and 'LHS_B'. From 'LHS_D', the role 'LHS_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'LHS_B', the role 'LHS_B4' has cardinality 0..*.
