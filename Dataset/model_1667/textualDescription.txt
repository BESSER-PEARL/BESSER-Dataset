The domain model 'hello121' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'hello121_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'hello121_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'hello121_Base' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'hello121_Classoc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'hello121_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'hello121_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'hello121_Third' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'hello121_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'hello121_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'hello121_Thing' and 'hello121_Base'. From 'hello121_Thing', the role 'hello121_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'hello121_Base', the role 'hello121_Base' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'hello121_Base' and 'hello121_Classoc'. From 'hello121_Base', the role 'hello121_Base2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'hello121_Classoc', the role 'hello121_Classoc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'hello121_RelatedTo' and 'hello121_Thing'. From 'hello121_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'hello121_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'hello121_Thing' and 'hello121_Third'. From 'hello121_Thing', the role 'hello121_Thing5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'hello121_Third', the role 'hello121_Third' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'hello121_Thing' and 'hello121_Classoc'. From 'hello121_Thing', the role 'hello121_Thing7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'hello121_Classoc', the role 'hello121_Classoc8' has cardinality 0..*.
