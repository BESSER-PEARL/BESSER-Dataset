The domain model 'attributes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'attributes_R' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'attributes_DocumentRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mixed', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str.

'attributes_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str; 'b', which is of type str; 'c', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'd', which is of type str.

'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'attributes_R' and 'attributes_A'. From 'attributes_R', the role 'attributes_R' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'attributes_A', the role 'attributes_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'attributes_DocumentRoot'. From 'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'attributes_DocumentRoot', the role 'attributes_DocumentRoot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry' and 'attributes_DocumentRoot'. From 'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry', the role 'attributes_EStringToStringMapEntry4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'attributes_DocumentRoot', the role 'attributes_DocumentRoot3' has cardinality 0..*.
