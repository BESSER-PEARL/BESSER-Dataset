Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Datentyp' defines the following possible values: 'String', 'Integer', 'Boolean', 'Date', 'Float', 'Email', 'Time'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
