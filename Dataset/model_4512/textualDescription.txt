The domain model 'iotsystem' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'iotsystem_Resource' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'url', which is of type str; 'measurement', which is of type str.

'iotsystem_IotSystem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'iotsystem_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_Condition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'expectedValue', which is of type float; 'relationalOperator', which is of type str.

'Device' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_Device' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_Actuator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'action', which is of type str.

'iotsystem_Rule' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iotsystem_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'EnvironmentConditions' defines the following possible values: 'SOUND', 'LIGHT', 'TEMPERATURE'.
The enumeration 'RelationalOperator' defines the following possible values: 'MAJOREQUAL', 'EQUAL', 'DIFFERENT', 'MINOREQUAL', 'MAJOR', 'MINOR'.
The enumeration 'Actions' defines the following possible values: 'EMAIL', 'SMS'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'iotsystem_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Device'.
The class 'iotsystem_Device' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'iotsystem_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Device'.
The class 'iotsystem_Rule' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'iotsystem_IotSystem' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Device' and 'iotsystem_Resource'. From 'iotsystem_Device', the role 'iotsystem_Device' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_Resource', the role 'iotsystem_Resource' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Resource' and 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact'. From 'iotsystem_Resource', the role 'iotsystem_Resource2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact', the role 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Rule' and 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact'. From 'iotsystem_Rule', the role 'iotsystem_Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact', the role 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Rule' and 'iotsystem_Action'. From 'iotsystem_Rule', the role 'iotsystem_Rule6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_Action', the role 'iotsystem_Action' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Condition' and 'iotsystem_Rule'. From 'iotsystem_Condition', the role 'iotsystem_Condition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_Rule', the role 'iotsystem_Rule8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Parameter' and 'iotsystem_Action'. From 'iotsystem_Parameter', the role 'iotsystem_Parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_Action', the role 'iotsystem_Action10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity' and 'iotsystem_Device'. From 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity', the role 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_Device', the role 'iotsystem_Device12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity' and 'iotsystem_IotSystem'. From 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity', the role 'iotsystem_PhysicalEntity14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_IotSystem', the role 'iotsystem_IotSystem' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_IotSystem' and 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact'. From 'iotsystem_IotSystem', the role 'iotsystem_IotSystem16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact', the role 'iotsystem_DigitalArtifact17' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iotsystem_Condition' and 'iotsystem_Sensor'. From 'iotsystem_Condition', the role 'iotsystem_Condition19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iotsystem_Sensor', the role 'iotsystem_Sensor' has cardinality 0..*.
