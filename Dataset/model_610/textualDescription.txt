The domain model 'mvc' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'mvc_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'mvc_MVCModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'version', which is of type str.

'mvc_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'mvc_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'mvc_UIComponent' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'layout', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str.

'mvc_EventAction' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mvc_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Annotable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mvc_Controller' represents an important domain concept.

'mvc_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'containment', which is of type bool; 'lowerBound', which is of type int; 'upperBound', which is of type int; 'type', which is of type str.

'mvc_ControllerView' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mvc_View' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AssociationType' is defined but does not specify any literals.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mvc_Model' is a specialization of 'Annotable'.
The class 'mvc_Entity' is a specialization of 'Annotable'.
