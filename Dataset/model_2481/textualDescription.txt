The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NoAnnotationSuper' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_NoAnnotationSuper' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_NoAnnotation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'b', which is of type str; 'a', which is of type str.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_NoAnnotation' is a specialization of 'NoAnnotationSuper'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_NoAnnotation'. From 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_NoAnnotation', the role 'fsm_NoAnnotation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_NoAnnotation'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_NoAnnotation', the role 'fsm_NoAnnotation2' has cardinality 0..*.
