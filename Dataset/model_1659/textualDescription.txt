The class 'testcompat103_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'testcompat103_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'testcompat103_Foo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'testcompat103_EClass0' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'testcompat103_EClass1' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'testcompat103_EClass2' is a specialization of 'EClass0'.
The class 'testcompat103_EClass3' is a specialization of 'World'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'testcompat103_Thing' and 'testcompat103_World'. From 'testcompat103_Thing', the role 'testcompat103_Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testcompat103_World', the role 'testcompat103_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testcompat103_World' and 'testcompat103_Foo'. From 'testcompat103_World', the role 'testcompat103_World2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testcompat103_Foo', the role 'testcompat103_Foo' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testcompat103_EClass0' and 'testcompat103_World'. From 'testcompat103_EClass0', the role 'testcompat103_EClass0' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testcompat103_World', the role 'testcompat103_World4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testcompat103_World' and 'testcompat103_EClass2'. From 'testcompat103_World', the role 'testcompat103_World6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testcompat103_EClass2', the role 'testcompat103_EClass2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'testcompat103_Thing' and 'testcompat103_RelatedTo'. From 'testcompat103_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'testcompat103_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
