Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'farrusco_Node' and 'farrusco_Robot'. From 'farrusco_Node', the role 'farrusco_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'farrusco_Robot', the role 'farrusco_Robot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'farrusco_Robot' and 'farrusco_Filho'. From 'farrusco_Robot', the role 'farrusco_Robot2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'farrusco_Filho', the role 'farrusco_Filho' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'farrusco_Robot' and 'farrusco_Irmao'. From 'farrusco_Robot', the role 'farrusco_Robot4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'farrusco_Irmao', the role 'farrusco_Irmao' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'farrusco_Filho' and 'farrusco_Behavior'. From 'farrusco_Filho', the role 'farrusco_Filho6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'farrusco_Behavior', the role 'farrusco_Behavior' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'farrusco_Filho' and 'farrusco_Node'. From 'farrusco_Filho', the role 'farrusco_Filho8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'farrusco_Node', the role 'farrusco_Node9' has cardinality 0..*.
