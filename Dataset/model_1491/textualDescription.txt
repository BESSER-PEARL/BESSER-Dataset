The domain model 'PetriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'location', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Element' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNet' and 'PetriNet_Element'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'net' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Element' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'outgoingArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'incomingArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Transition' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'outgoingArc6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'Place9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'incomingArc8' has cardinality 0..*.
