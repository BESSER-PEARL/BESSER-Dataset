The domain model 'arduinoML' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'arduinoML_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'arduinoML_Actuator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoML_App' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoML_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'arduinoML_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Brick' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoML_Action' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'arduinoML_Brick' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'pin', which is of type int.

'arduinoML_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Signal' defines the following possible values: 'HIGH', 'LOW'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'arduinoML_Brick' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_Actuator' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_Sensor' is a specialization of 'Brick'.
The class 'arduinoML_App' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'arduinoML_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'arduinoML_App' and 'arduinoML_Brick'. From 'arduinoML_App', the role 'arduinoML_App' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_Brick', the role 'arduinoML_Brick' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_App' and 'arduinoML_State'. From 'arduinoML_App', the role 'arduinoML_App2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_State' and 'arduinoML_App'. From 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_App', the role 'arduinoML_App4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_State' and 'arduinoML_Action'. From 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_Action', the role 'arduinoML_Action' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_Transition' and 'arduinoML_State'. From 'arduinoML_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_State', the role 'state' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_Action' and 'arduinoML_Actuator'. From 'arduinoML_Action', the role 'arduinoML_Action10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_Actuator', the role 'arduinoML_Actuator' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_Transition' and 'arduinoML_State'. From 'arduinoML_Transition', the role 'arduinoML_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_State', the role 'arduinoML_State12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_Sensor' and 'arduinoML_Transition'. From 'arduinoML_Sensor', the role 'arduinoML_Sensor' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_Transition', the role 'arduinoML_Transition14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'arduinoML_Transition' and 'arduinoML_State'. From 'arduinoML_Transition', the role 'transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'arduinoML_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
