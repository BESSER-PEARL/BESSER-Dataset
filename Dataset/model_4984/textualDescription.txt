An association connects 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port' and 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Component'. From 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port', the role 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Component', the role 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Component' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Connector' and 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port'. From 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Connector', the role 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Connector' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port', the role 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Connector' and 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port'. From 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Connector', the role 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Connector4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port', the role 'ComponentLanguageShallow_Port5' has cardinality 0..*.
