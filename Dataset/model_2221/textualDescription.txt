The domain model 'study' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'study_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'season', which is of type str; 'credits', which is of type float; 'year', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'study_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'year', which is of type int; 'season', which is of type str.

'study_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'numYears', which is of type int; 'code', which is of type str.

'study_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'study_courseAllocation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'grade', which is of type str.

'study_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'study_Specialisation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'requirement', which is of type str.

'study_StudyPlan' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'grades' defines the following possible values: 'E', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'C', 'F'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
