The class 'manypov2_B' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_C' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_E' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_F' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_J' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_K' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_JK' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_M' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'manypov2_N' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'manypov2_A' and 'manypov2_B'. From 'manypov2_A', the role 'manypov2_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_B', the role 'manypov2_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_A' and 'manypov2_E'. From 'manypov2_A', the role 'manypov2_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_E', the role 'manypov2_E' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_J' and 'manypov2_A'. From 'manypov2_J', the role 'manypov2_J' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_A', the role 'manypov2_A4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_K' and 'manypov2_A'. From 'manypov2_K', the role 'manypov2_K' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_A', the role 'manypov2_A6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_B' and 'manypov2_C'. From 'manypov2_B', the role 'manypov2_B8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_C', the role 'manypov2_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_F' and 'manypov2_E'. From 'manypov2_F', the role 'manypov2_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_E', the role 'manypov2_E10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_JK' and 'manypov2_J'. From 'manypov2_JK', the role 'manypov2_JK' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_J', the role 'manypov2_J12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'manypov2_M' and 'manypov2_K'. From 'manypov2_M', the role 'manypov2_M' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'manypov2_K', the role 'manypov2_K14' has cardinality 0..*.
