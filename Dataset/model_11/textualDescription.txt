The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RefNodes' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'RefPetriNets'.
The class 'petrinet_Node' is a specialization of 'RefNodes'.
The class 'petrinet_Arc' is a specialization of 'RefArcs'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Token' is a specialization of 'RefTokens'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_RefNodes'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_RefNodes', the role 'petrinet_RefNodes' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_RefArcs'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_RefArcs', the role 'petrinet_RefArcs' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_RefNodes' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_RefNodes', the role 'petrinet_RefNodes4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'petrinet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Arc' and 'petrinet_RefNodes'. From 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'petrinet_Arc6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_RefNodes', the role 'petrinet_RefNodes7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_RefTokens' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_RefTokens', the role 'petrinet_RefTokens' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*.
