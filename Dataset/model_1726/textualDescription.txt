The domain model 'emap' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'emap_Book' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'title', which is of type str.

'emap_StringToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'key', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str.

'emap_WriterToStringMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'emap_DateToCategoryMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'key', which is of type str.

'emap_Writer' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'emap_StringToWriterMapEntry' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'key', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Category' defines the following possible values: 'Simple', 'Complex'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
