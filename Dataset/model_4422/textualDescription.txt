The domain model 'iot' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'iot_Sensor' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iot_IotOperationDef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HWComp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iot_Actuator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iot_Board' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'iot_IotActivity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iot_System' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'iot_Sketch' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'iot_HWComp' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BoardType' defines the following possible values: 'BeagleBoard', 'RaspberryPi', 'Arduino'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'iot_Sensor' is a specialization of 'HWComp'.
The class 'iot_Actuator' is a specialization of 'HWComp'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'iot_HWComp' and 'iot_IotOperationDef'. From 'iot_HWComp', the role 'iot_HWComp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iot_IotOperationDef', the role 'iot_IotOperationDef' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iot_System' and 'iot_HWComp'. From 'iot_System', the role 'iot_System' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iot_HWComp', the role 'iot_HWComp2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iot_System' and 'iot_Board'. From 'iot_System', the role 'iot_System4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iot_Board', the role 'iot_Board' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iot_Sketch' and 'iot_System'. From 'iot_Sketch', the role 'iot_Sketch' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iot_System', the role 'iot_System6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iot_HWComp' and 'iot_Board'. From 'iot_HWComp', the role 'iot_HWComp9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iot_Board', the role 'iot_Board8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'iot_Sketch' and 'iot_IotActivity'. From 'iot_Sketch', the role 'iot_Sketch11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'iot_IotActivity', the role 'iot_IotActivity' has cardinality 0..*.
