The domain model 'studyprograms' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'studyprograms_CourseAccess' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Access', which is of type str.

'studyprograms_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'year', which is of type int; 'semesterType', which is of type str; 'semesterCode', which is of type str.

'studyprograms_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'studyprograms_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'availableSemester', which is of type str; 'ects', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str; 'level', which is of type str.

'studyprograms_Specialisation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'startSemester', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'studyprograms_Programme' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'duration', which is of type int; 'startYear', which is of type int; 'code', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AvailableSemesters' defines the following possible values: 'Spring', 'Fall', 'Both'.
The enumeration 'SemesterType' defines the following possible values: 'Spring', 'Fall'.
The enumeration 'Level' defines the following possible values: 'Master', 'Bachelor'.
The enumeration 'Access' defines the following possible values: 'M2A', 'O', 'VA', 'M1A', 'VB', 'NoAccess'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
