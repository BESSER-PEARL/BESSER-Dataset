The domain model 'featuretree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'featuretree_FeatureTree' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'core_ITopLevelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'features_IFeatureDomain' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'featuretree_TreeFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'mandatory', which is of type bool.

'core_AbstractModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'featuretree_FeatureTree' is a specialization of 'core_AbstractModelElement'.
The class 'featuretree_FeatureTree' is a specialization of 'features_IFeatureDomain'.
The class 'featuretree_FeatureTree' is a specialization of 'core_ITopLevelElement'.
The class 'featuretree_TreeFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'featuretree_FeatureTree' and 'featuretree_TreeFeature'. From 'featuretree_FeatureTree', the role 'featuretree_FeatureTree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featuretree_TreeFeature', the role 'featuretree_TreeFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'featuretree_TreeFeature' and 'featuretree_TreeFeature'. From 'featuretree_TreeFeature', the role 'featuretree_TreeFeature1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'featuretree_TreeFeature', the role 'featuretree_TreeFeature3' has cardinality 0..*.
