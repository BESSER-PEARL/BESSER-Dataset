The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'k5_A' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'k5_B' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'k5_C' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'k5_M' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'k5_N' is a specialization of 'M'.
The class 'k5_J' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'k5_P' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'k5_Q' is a specialization of 'P'.
The class 'k5_I' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'k5_K' is a specialization of 'J'.
The class 'k5_L3' is a specialization of 'L1'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
