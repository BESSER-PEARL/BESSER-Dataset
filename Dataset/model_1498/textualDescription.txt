The domain model 'PetriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'PetriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'poids', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_PetriElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nbJeton', which is of type str; 'borne', which is of type str.

'PetriElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ArcType' defines the following possible values: 'Normal', 'Read_arc'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'PetriElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'PetriElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_PetriElement'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriElement' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' and 'PetriNet_PetriElement'. From 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri', the role 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri', the role 'PetriNet_ReseauPetri7' has cardinality 0..*.
