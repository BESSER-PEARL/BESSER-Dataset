'era_System' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'era_Relationship' represents an important domain concept.

It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'inDomain', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'era_System' and 'era_Entity'. From 'era_System', the role 'system' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'era_Entity', the role 'Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'era_Entity' and 'era_System'. From 'era_Entity', the role 'entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'era_System', the role 'System' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'era_Relationship' and 'era_Entity'. From 'era_Relationship', the role 'Relationship' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'era_Entity', the role 'entities' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'era_Relationship' and 'era_Entity'. From 'era_Relationship', the role 'relationships' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'era_Entity', the role 'Entity4' has cardinality 0..*.
