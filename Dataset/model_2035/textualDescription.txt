The domain model 'eMFProject' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'eMFProject_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'eMFProject_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'code', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'eMFProject_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'eMFProject_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'eMFProject_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'eMFProject_Event' and 'eMFProject_Statemachine'. From 'eMFProject_Event', the role 'eMFProject_Event' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_Statemachine', the role 'eMFProject_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'eMFProject_Event' and 'eMFProject_Statemachine'. From 'eMFProject_Event', the role 'eMFProject_Event3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_Statemachine', the role 'eMFProject_Statemachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'eMFProject_Statemachine' and 'eMFProject_Command'. From 'eMFProject_Statemachine', the role 'eMFProject_Statemachine5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_Command', the role 'eMFProject_Command' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'eMFProject_State' and 'eMFProject_Statemachine'. From 'eMFProject_State', the role 'eMFProject_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_Statemachine', the role 'eMFProject_Statemachine7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'eMFProject_Command' and 'eMFProject_State'. From 'eMFProject_Command', the role 'eMFProject_Command10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_State', the role 'eMFProject_State9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'eMFProject_State' and 'eMFProject_Transition'. From 'eMFProject_State', the role 'eMFProject_State12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_Transition', the role 'eMFProject_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'eMFProject_Event' and 'eMFProject_Transition'. From 'eMFProject_Event', the role 'eMFProject_Event15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'eMFProject_Transition', the role 'eMFProject_Transition14' has cardinality 0..*.
