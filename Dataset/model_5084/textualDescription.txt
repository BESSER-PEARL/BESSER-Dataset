The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'adl199_Required' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adl199_Provided' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adl199_Component' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.
The class 'adl199_Delegation' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adl199_AtomicComponent' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'adl199_AbstractComponent' and 'adl199_Content'. From 'adl199_AbstractComponent', the role 'adl199_AbstractComponent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl199_Content', the role 'adl199_Content' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adl199_AbstractComponent' and 'adl199_Required'. From 'adl199_AbstractComponent', the role 'adl199_AbstractComponent2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl199_Required', the role 'adl199_Required' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adl199_Provided' and 'adl199_AbstractComponent'. From 'adl199_Provided', the role 'adl199_Provided' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adl199_AbstractComponent', the role 'adl199_AbstractComponent4' has cardinality 0..*.
