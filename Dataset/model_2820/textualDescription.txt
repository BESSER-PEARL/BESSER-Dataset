Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Alignment' defines the following possible values: 'UNSPECIFIED', 'MIDDLE', 'CENTER', 'BOTTOM', 'TOP', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sofiagraphics_Rectangle' is a specialization of 'Widget'.
The class 'sofiagraphics_RoundedRectangle' is a specialization of 'Rectangle'.
The class 'sofiagraphics_Ellipse' is a specialization of 'Widget'.
The class 'sofiagraphics_Polyline' is a specialization of 'Widget'.
The class 'sofiagraphics_Text' is a specialization of 'Widget'.
