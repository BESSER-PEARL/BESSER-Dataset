The domain model 'target' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'target_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'target_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'target_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'target_H' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'target_G' is a specialization of 'F'.
The class 'target_H' is a specialization of 'F'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'target_F' and 'target_E'. From 'target_F', the role 'target_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'target_E', the role 'target_E' has cardinality 0..*.
