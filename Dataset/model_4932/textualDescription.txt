The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'form_InputField' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'form_TextField' is a specialization of 'InputField'.
The class 'form_SelectionField' is a specialization of 'InputField'.

The class 'form_Text' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'form_Heading' is a specialization of 'Text'.
The class 'form_Paragraph' is a specialization of 'Text'.
The class 'form_List' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'form_SelectionCondition' is a specialization of 'VisibilityCondition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'form_Page' and 'form_Form'. From 'form_Page', the role 'form_Page' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'form_Form', the role 'form_Form' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'form_Page' and 'form_Form'. From 'form_Page', the role 'form_Page3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'form_Form', the role 'form_Form2' has cardinality 0..*.
