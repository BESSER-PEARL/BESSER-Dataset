The domain model 'd' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'd_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'd_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'd_D' and 'd_B'. From 'd_D', the role 'd_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'd_B', the role 'd_B' has cardinality 0..*.
