The domain model 'petrinet2' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'petrinet2_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet2_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'minDelay', which is of type float; 'maxDelay', which is of type float.

'petrinet2_Petrinet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet2_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet2_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet2_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet2_Node' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'petrinet2_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet2_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet2_Arc' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet2_Element' and 'petrinet2_Petrinet'. From 'petrinet2_Element', the role 'petrinet2_Element' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet2_Petrinet', the role 'petrinet2_Petrinet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet2_Node' and 'petrinet2_Arc'. From 'petrinet2_Node', the role 'petrinet2_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet2_Arc', the role 'petrinet2_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet2_Node' and 'petrinet2_Arc'. From 'petrinet2_Node', the role 'petrinet2_Node4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet2_Arc', the role 'petrinet2_Arc3' has cardinality 0..*.
