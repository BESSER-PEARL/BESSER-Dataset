The domain model 'tree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'TreeNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tree_NonTerminal' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tree_TreeNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'data', which is of type str.

'tree_Leaf' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tree_Leaf' is a specialization of 'TreeNode'.
The class 'tree_NonTerminal' is a specialization of 'TreeNode'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tree_TreeNode' and 'tree_TreeNode'. From 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'tree_TreeNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'tree_TreeNode0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_NonTerminal' and 'tree_TreeNode'. From 'tree_NonTerminal', the role 'tree_NonTerminal' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'tree_TreeNode3' has cardinality 0..*.
