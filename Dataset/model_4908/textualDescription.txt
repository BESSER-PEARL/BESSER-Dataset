Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ServiceClassType' defines the following possible values: 'Bronze', 'Gold', 'Silver'.
The enumeration 'ResourceOriginType' defines the following possible values: 'Internal', 'InBound', 'OutBound'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'services_CFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.
The class 'services_CIID' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_DerivedResource' is a specialization of 'BaseResource'.
The class 'services_DistributionEntry' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_RFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.
The class 'services_Service' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_ServiceDistribution' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_ServiceForecast' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_ServiceForecastUsers' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_ServiceMonitor' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_ServiceProfile' is a specialization of 'Base'.
The class 'services_ServiceUser' is a specialization of 'Base'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
