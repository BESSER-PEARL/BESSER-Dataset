The domain model 'B' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'B_B1' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'B_B2' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'B_B1' and 'B_B2'. From 'B_B1', the role 'B_B1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'B_B2', the role 'B_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
