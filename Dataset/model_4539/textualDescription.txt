Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'House2_House' and 'House2_Room'. From 'House2_House', the role 'House2_House' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'House2_Room', the role 'House2_Room' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'House2_ControlRule' and 'House2_House'. From 'House2_ControlRule', the role 'House2_ControlRule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'House2_House', the role 'House2_House2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'House2_Element' and 'House2_Container'. From 'House2_Element', the role 'House2_Element' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'House2_Container', the role 'House2_Container' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'House2_Container' and 'House2_Sensor'. From 'House2_Container', the role 'House2_Container5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'House2_Sensor', the role 'House2_Sensor' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'House2_Container' and 'House2_Actor'. From 'House2_Container', the role 'House2_Container7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'House2_Actor', the role 'House2_Actor' has cardinality 0..*.
