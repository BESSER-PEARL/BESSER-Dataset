The domain model 'expressions' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'expressions_BoolConstant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'expressions_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'expressions_AbstractElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'expressions_Plus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'expressions_VariableRef' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'expressions_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'expressions_ExpressionsModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'AbstractElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'expressions_IntConstant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'expressions_StringConstant' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'expressions_Variable' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'expressions_Expression' is a specialization of 'AbstractElement'.
The class 'expressions_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_IntConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_StringConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_BoolConstant' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'expressions_VariableRef' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'expressions_ExpressionsModel' and 'expressions_AbstractElement'. From 'expressions_ExpressionsModel', the role 'expressions_ExpressionsModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_AbstractElement', the role 'expressions_AbstractElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_Expression' and 'expressions_Variable'. From 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Variable', the role 'expressions_Variable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_Plus' and 'expressions_Expression'. From 'expressions_Plus', the role 'expressions_Plus' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_Expression' and 'expressions_Plus'. From 'expressions_Expression', the role 'expressions_Expression6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Plus', the role 'expressions_Plus5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'expressions_VariableRef' and 'expressions_Variable'. From 'expressions_VariableRef', the role 'expressions_VariableRef' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_Variable', the role 'expressions_Variable8' has cardinality 0..*.
