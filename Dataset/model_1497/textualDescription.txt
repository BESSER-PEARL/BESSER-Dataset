The domain model 'PetriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'PetriElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nbJetons', which is of type int.

'PetriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'arcType', which is of type str; 'poids', which is of type int.

'PetriNet_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_PetriElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nom', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ArcType' defines the following possible values: 'ReadArc', 'Arc'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'PetriElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'PetriElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriElement' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_PetriElement'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNet' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriElement' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_PetriElement', the role 'PetriNet_PetriElement8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet_PetriNet7' has cardinality 0..*.
