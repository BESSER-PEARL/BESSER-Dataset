Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'DLayout' defines the following possible values: 'none', 'vertical', 'free', 'horizontal'.
The enumeration 'DDirection' defines the following possible values: 'none', 'right', 'bidirectional', 'left'.
The enumeration 'DAlignment' defines the following possible values: 'center', 'fill', 'beginning', 'end'.
The enumeration 'DLine' defines the following possible values: 'dash', 'custom', 'solid', 'dashdot', 'dashdotdot', 'dot'.
The enumeration 'DColor' defines the following possible values: 'blue', 'white', 'darkGreen', 'yellow', 'darkBlue', 'orange', 'black', 'lightGreen', 'darkGray', 'gray', 'red', 'green', 'lightBlue', 'cyan', 'lightGray'.
The enumeration 'DFontStyle' defines the following possible values: 'normal', 'bold', 'italic'.
The enumeration 'DShape' defines the following possible values: 'rectangle', 'arrow', 'custom', 'dot', 'triangle', 'roundedRectangle', 'ellipse'.
The enumeration 'DFontName' defines the following possible values: 'courier', 'arial', 'times'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'diastyle_DNodeEdgeStyle' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'diastyle_DNodeEdgeStyle' is a specialization of 'DBaseStyle'.
The class 'diastyle_DStyle' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'diastyle_DNodeStyle' is a specialization of 'DNodeEdgeStyle'.
The class 'diastyle_DEdgeStyle' is a specialization of 'DNodeEdgeStyle'.
The class 'diastyle_DNestingEdgeStyle' is a specialization of 'DBaseStyle'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'diastyle_DBaseStyle' and 'diastyle_DStyle'. From 'diastyle_DBaseStyle', the role 'diastyle_DBaseStyle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'diastyle_DStyle', the role 'diastyle_DStyle' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'diastyle_DStyle' and 'diastyle_DGraph'. From 'diastyle_DStyle', the role 'diastyle_DStyle2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'diastyle_DGraph', the role 'diastyle_DGraph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'diastyle_DStyleBridge' and 'diastyle_DGraphElement'. From 'diastyle_DStyleBridge', the role 'diastyle_DStyleBridge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'diastyle_DGraphElement', the role 'diastyle_DGraphElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'diastyle_DBaseStyle' and 'diastyle_DStyleBridge'. From 'diastyle_DBaseStyle', the role 'diastyle_DBaseStyle5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'diastyle_DStyleBridge', the role 'diastyle_DStyleBridge6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'diastyle_DBaseStyle' and 'diastyle_DBaseStyle'. From 'diastyle_DBaseStyle', the role 'diastyle_DBaseStyle7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'diastyle_DBaseStyle', the role 'diastyle_DBaseStyle9' has cardinality 0..*.
