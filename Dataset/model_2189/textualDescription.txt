The model defines 2 main class(es).

'tree_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tree_TreeNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tree_TreeNode' and 'tree_TreeNode'. From 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'TreeNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_TreeNode' and 'tree_TreeNode'. From 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'parent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'TreeNode4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_TreeNode' and 'tree_EObject'. From 'tree_TreeNode', the role 'tree_TreeNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_EObject', the role 'tree_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
