The domain model 'cgimodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'cgimodel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cgimodel_BaseState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'cgimodel_OrState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cgimodel_Expr' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'cgimodel_StateModels' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BaseState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cgimodel_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'set', which is of type bool.

'cgimodel_StateModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'cgimodel_State' is a specialization of 'BaseState'.
The class 'cgimodel_OrState' is a specialization of 'BaseState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'cgimodel_BaseState' and 'cgimodel_StateModel'. From 'cgimodel_BaseState', the role 'cgimodel_BaseState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cgimodel_StateModel', the role 'cgimodel_StateModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cgimodel_Transition' and 'cgimodel_StateModel'. From 'cgimodel_Transition', the role 'cgimodel_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cgimodel_StateModel', the role 'cgimodel_StateModel2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cgimodel_State' and 'cgimodel_Expr'. From 'cgimodel_State', the role 'cgimodel_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cgimodel_Expr', the role 'cgimodel_Expr' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cgimodel_OrState' and 'cgimodel_BaseState'. From 'cgimodel_OrState', the role 'cgimodel_OrState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cgimodel_BaseState', the role 'cgimodel_BaseState5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cgimodel_BaseState' and 'cgimodel_Transition'. From 'cgimodel_BaseState', the role 'cgimodel_BaseState8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cgimodel_Transition', the role 'cgimodel_Transition7' has cardinality 0..*.
