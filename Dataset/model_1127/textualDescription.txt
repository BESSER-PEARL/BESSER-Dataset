The domain model 'robotmodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 11 main class(es).

'robotmodel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'robotmodel_System' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'author_email', which is of type str; 'author', which is of type str; 'depends', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Is_Style' defines the following possible values: 'style', 'non_style'.
