The domain model 'FSM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'FSM_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'input', which is of type str.

'FSM_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'FSM_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'isAccepting', which is of type bool.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'FSM_State' and 'FSM_StateMachine'. From 'FSM_State', the role 'FSM_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FSM_StateMachine', the role 'FSM_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FSM_State' and 'FSM_StateMachine'. From 'FSM_State', the role 'FSM_State3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FSM_StateMachine', the role 'FSM_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FSM_Transition' and 'FSM_State'. From 'FSM_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FSM_State', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FSM_Transition' and 'FSM_State'. From 'FSM_Transition', the role 'Transition6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FSM_State', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FSM_Transition' and 'FSM_State'. From 'FSM_Transition', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FSM_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'FSM_Transition' and 'FSM_State'. From 'FSM_Transition', the role 'incoming' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'FSM_State', the role 'State9' has cardinality 0..*.
