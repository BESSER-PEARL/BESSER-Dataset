Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Net' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_Net', the role 'Net' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Place' and 'PetriNet_PTArc'. From 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'src' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PTArc', the role 'PTArc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_TPArc' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_TPArc', the role 'TPArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'dst' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Net' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_Net', the role 'Net4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PTArc' and 'PetriNet_Transition'. From 'PetriNet_PTArc', the role 'PTArc7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Transition', the role 'dst6' has cardinality 0..*.
