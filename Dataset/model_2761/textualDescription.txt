The domain model 'simpletest' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'simpletest_N' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simpletest_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpletest_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpletest_L' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'N' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpletest_X' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simpletest_A' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'simpletest_B' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'simpletest_L' is a specialization of 'N'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpletest_A' and 'simpletest_B'. From 'simpletest_A', the role 'simpletest_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpletest_B', the role 'simpletest_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpletest_L' and 'simpletest_A'. From 'simpletest_L', the role 'simpletest_L' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpletest_A', the role 'simpletest_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpletest_X' and 'simpletest_A'. From 'simpletest_X', the role 'simpletest_X' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpletest_A', the role 'simpletest_A4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpletest_A' and 'simpletest_L'. From 'simpletest_A', the role 'simpletest_A7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpletest_L', the role 'simpletest_L6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpletest_L' and 'simpletest_B'. From 'simpletest_L', the role 'simpletest_L9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpletest_B', the role 'simpletest_B10' has cardinality 0..*.
