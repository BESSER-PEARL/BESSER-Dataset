Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MaintenanceType' defines the following possible values: '_2ndLineMaintenance', '_1stLineMaintenance'.

The enumeration 'LifeCycleStateType' defines the following possible values: 'Active', 'Removed', 'Planned'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'services_CFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.
The class 'services_RFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'services_CFSService' and 'services_EObject'. From 'services_CFSService', the role 'services_CFSService' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'services_EObject', the role 'services_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
