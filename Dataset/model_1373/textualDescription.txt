The domain model 'statemachines' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'statemachines_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachines_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'statemachines_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'code', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'statemachines_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'statemachines_StateMachine' and 'statemachines_State'. From 'statemachines_StateMachine', the role 'statemachines_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachines_State', the role 'statemachines_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachines_Event' and 'statemachines_StateMachine'. From 'statemachines_Event', the role 'statemachines_Event' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachines_StateMachine', the role 'statemachines_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachines_StateMachine' and 'statemachines_Event'. From 'statemachines_StateMachine', the role 'statemachines_StateMachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachines_Event', the role 'statemachines_Event5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachines_Transition' and 'statemachines_State'. From 'statemachines_Transition', the role 'statemachines_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachines_State', the role 'statemachines_State7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachines_State' and 'statemachines_Transition'. From 'statemachines_State', the role 'statemachines_State10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachines_Transition', the role 'statemachines_Transition9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'statemachines_Transition' and 'statemachines_Event'. From 'statemachines_Transition', the role 'statemachines_Transition12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'statemachines_Event', the role 'statemachines_Event13' has cardinality 0..*.
