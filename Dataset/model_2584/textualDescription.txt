The domain model 'atomic' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'atomic_XAnnotable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'atomic_ANode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'XAnnotable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'atomic_AStructured' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'atomic_AGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'corpus', which is of type str.

'atomic_ATargetEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'atomic_AEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'atomic_AToken' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'ANode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'atomic_AToken' is a specialization of 'ANode'.
The class 'atomic_ANode' is a specialization of 'XAnnotable'.
The class 'atomic_AStructured' is a specialization of 'ANode'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'atomic_AGraph' and 'atomic_AToken'. From 'atomic_AGraph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'atomic_AToken', the role 'AToken' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'atomic_AGraph' and 'atomic_AStructured'. From 'atomic_AGraph', the role 'graph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'atomic_AStructured', the role 'AStructured' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'atomic_AEdge' and 'atomic_AGraph'. From 'atomic_AEdge', the role 'AEdge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'atomic_AGraph', the role 'graph4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'atomic_AToken' and 'atomic_AToken'. From 'atomic_AToken', the role 'AToken7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'atomic_AToken', the role 'previous' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'atomic_AToken' and 'atomic_AToken'. From 'atomic_AToken', the role 'AToken10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'atomic_AToken', the role 'next' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'atomic_AToken' and 'atomic_AGraph'. From 'atomic_AToken', the role 'tokens' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'atomic_AGraph', the role 'AGraph' has cardinality 0..*.
