The domain model 'study' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'study_StudyProgramme' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str; 'numYears', which is of type int.

'study_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'code', which is of type str; 'level', which is of type int; 'credits', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str.

'study_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'numYears', which is of type int.

'study_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'username', which is of type str.

'study_ElectiveCourseList' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'study_CourseRelationship' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'grade', which is of type str; 'numExamAttempts', which is of type int.

'study_IndividualStudyPlan' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'study_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ordinal', which is of type int.

'study_University' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'GradeEnum' defines the following possible values: 'B', 'NONE', 'E', 'A', 'F', 'D', 'C'.
