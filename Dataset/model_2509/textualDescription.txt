The domain model 'refact' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'refact_Named' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'refact_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refact_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refact_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refact_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'refact_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'refact_B' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refact_C' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refact_D' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'refact_E' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'refact_A' and 'refact_B'. From 'refact_A', the role 'refact_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_B', the role 'refact_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_A' and 'refact_E'. From 'refact_A', the role 'refact_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_E', the role 'refact_E' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_D' and 'refact_B'. From 'refact_D', the role 'refact_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_B', the role 'refact_B4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_B' and 'refact_E'. From 'refact_B', the role 'refact_B6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_E', the role 'refact_E7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_C' and 'refact_B'. From 'refact_C', the role 'refact_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_B', the role 'refact_B9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_B' and 'refact_C'. From 'refact_B', the role 'refact_B12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_C', the role 'refact_C11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_B' and 'refact_C'. From 'refact_B', the role 'refact_B15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_C', the role 'refact_C14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'refact_D' and 'refact_E'. From 'refact_D', the role 'refact_D17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'refact_E', the role 'refact_E18' has cardinality 0..*.
