Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PseudostateKind' defines a single possible value: 'initial'.
The enumeration 'RelationalOperator' defines the following possible values: 'greaterThan', 'greaterThanOrEqualTo', 'lessThanOrEqualTo', 'notEqual', 'equals', 'lessThan'.
The enumeration 'ArithmeticOperator' defines the following possible values: 'div', 'plus', 'mult', 'minus'.
