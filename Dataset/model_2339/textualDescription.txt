An association connects 'persons_Person' and 'persons_Community'. From 'persons_Person', the role 'persons_Person' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_Community', the role 'persons_Community' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_Community' and 'persons_TownHall'. From 'persons_Community', the role 'persons_Community2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_TownHall', the role 'persons_TownHall' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_Association' and 'persons_Community'. From 'persons_Association', the role 'persons_Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_Community', the role 'persons_Community4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_TownHall' and 'persons_Person'. From 'persons_TownHall', the role 'persons_TownHall6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_Person', the role 'persons_Person7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_Committee' and 'persons_TownHall'. From 'persons_Committee', the role 'persons_Committee' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_TownHall', the role 'persons_TownHall9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_District' and 'persons_TownHall'. From 'persons_District', the role 'persons_District' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_TownHall', the role 'persons_TownHall11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_District' and 'persons_Facility'. From 'persons_District', the role 'persons_District13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_Facility', the role 'persons_Facility' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'persons_Facility' and 'persons_Person'. From 'persons_Facility', the role 'persons_Facility15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'persons_Person', the role 'persons_Person16' has cardinality 0..*.
