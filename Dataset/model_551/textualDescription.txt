An association connects 'familyTree_FamilyTree' and 'familyTree_Person'. From 'familyTree_FamilyTree', the role 'tree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Person', the role 'Person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Male' and 'familyTree_Person'. From 'familyTree_Male', the role 'Male' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Person', the role 'children' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Female' and 'familyTree_Person'. From 'familyTree_Female', the role 'Female' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Person', the role 'children3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Person' and 'familyTree_FamilyTree'. From 'familyTree_Person', the role 'leaves' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_FamilyTree', the role 'FamilyTree' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Male' and 'familyTree_Female'. From 'familyTree_Male', the role 'husband' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Female', the role 'Female6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Person' and 'familyTree_Male'. From 'familyTree_Person', the role 'Person8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Male', the role 'father' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Female' and 'familyTree_Male'. From 'familyTree_Female', the role 'wife' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Male', the role 'Male10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'familyTree_Person' and 'familyTree_Female'. From 'familyTree_Person', the role 'Person12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'familyTree_Female', the role 'mother' has cardinality 0..*.
