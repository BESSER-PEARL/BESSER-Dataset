Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mil_Instruction' and 'mil_MILModel'. From 'mil_Instruction', the role 'mil_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_MILModel', the role 'mil_MILModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_Value' and 'mil_LoadInstruction'. From 'mil_Value', the role 'mil_Value' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_LoadInstruction', the role 'mil_LoadInstruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_RegisterReference' and 'mil_StoreInstruction'. From 'mil_RegisterReference', the role 'mil_RegisterReference' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_StoreInstruction', the role 'mil_StoreInstruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_LabelInstruction' and 'mil_JumpInstruction'. From 'mil_LabelInstruction', the role 'mil_LabelInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_JumpInstruction', the role 'mil_JumpInstruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_InpInstruction' and 'mil_ConstantInteger'. From 'mil_InpInstruction', the role 'mil_InpInstruction' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_ConstantInteger', the role 'mil_ConstantInteger' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mil_InpInstruction' and 'mil_ConstantInteger'. From 'mil_InpInstruction', the role 'mil_InpInstruction6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mil_ConstantInteger', the role 'mil_ConstantInteger7' has cardinality 0..*.
