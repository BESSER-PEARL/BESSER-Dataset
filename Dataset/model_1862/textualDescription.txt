The domain model 'beans' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'beans_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'beans_Bean' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'beans_BeanProperty' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'typeName', which is of type str; 'changeable', which is of type bool.

'beans_BeanLibrary' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'packageName', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'beans_BeanLibrary' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'beans_Bean' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'beans_BeanProperty' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'beans_Bean' and 'beans_BeanLibrary'. From 'beans_Bean', the role 'Bean' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'beans_BeanLibrary', the role 'beanLibrary' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'beans_BeanLibrary' and 'beans_Bean'. From 'beans_BeanLibrary', the role 'BeanLibrary' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'beans_Bean', the role 'beans' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'beans_Bean' and 'beans_BeanProperty'. From 'beans_Bean', the role 'bean' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'beans_BeanProperty', the role 'BeanProperty' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'beans_BeanProperty' and 'beans_Bean'. From 'beans_BeanProperty', the role 'properties' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'beans_Bean', the role 'Bean4' has cardinality 0..*.
