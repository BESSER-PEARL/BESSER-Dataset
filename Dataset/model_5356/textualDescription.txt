The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'test_Container' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'barA', which is of type str.

'test_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'fooA', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_Foo' and 'test_Container'. From 'test_Foo', the role 'test_Foo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Container', the role 'test_Container' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_Bar' and 'test_Container'. From 'test_Bar', the role 'test_Bar' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Container', the role 'test_Container2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_Bar' and 'test_Foo'. From 'test_Bar', the role 'test_Bar4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Foo', the role 'test_Foo5' has cardinality 0..*.
