The domain model 'tutorial' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'tutorial_Loan' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'date', which is of type date.

'tutorial_SubOrg2_sb2C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tutorial_Organization_Librarian' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SubOrg1_sb1C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines a single possible value: 'asd'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tutorial_Organization_Librarian' is a specialization of 'Employee'.
The class 'tutorial_Organization_Ref' is a specialization of 'Library'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tutorial_Library' and 'tutorial_Book'. From 'tutorial_Library', the role 'library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Book', the role 'Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Library' and 'tutorial_Loan'. From 'tutorial_Library', the role 'tutorial_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Loan', the role 'tutorial_Loan' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Member' and 'tutorial_Library'. From 'tutorial_Member', the role 'Member' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Library', the role 'library3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tutorial_Book' and 'tutorial_Library'. From 'tutorial_Book', the role 'books' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tutorial_Library', the role 'Library' has cardinality 0..*.
