The domain model 'direction' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'direction_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'direction_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'direction_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'direction_B' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'direction_A' and 'direction_C'. From 'direction_A', the role 'direction_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'direction_C', the role 'direction_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'direction_B' and 'direction_C'. From 'direction_B', the role 'direction_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'direction_C', the role 'direction_C2' has cardinality 0..*.
