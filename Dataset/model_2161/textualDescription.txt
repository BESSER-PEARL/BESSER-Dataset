The domain model 'egt' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'egt_Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'index', which is of type int; 'color', which is of type str.

'egt_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'color', which is of type str; 'weight', which is of type float.

'Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'egt_SingleEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'egt_ColorRegistry' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'images', which is of type str.

'egt_DiEdge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'egt_GraphModel' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Colors' defines the following possible values: 'performed', 'clean', 'touched'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'egt_DiEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.
The class 'egt_SingleEdge' is a specialization of 'Edge'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'egt_Vertex' and 'egt_Edge'. From 'egt_Vertex', the role 'egt_Vertex' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egt_Edge', the role 'egt_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egt_Vertex' and 'egt_Edge'. From 'egt_Vertex', the role 'egt_Vertex3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egt_Edge', the role 'egt_Edge2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egt_GraphModel' and 'egt_Vertex'. From 'egt_GraphModel', the role 'egt_GraphModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egt_Vertex', the role 'egt_Vertex5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egt_ColorRegistry' and 'egt_GraphModel'. From 'egt_ColorRegistry', the role 'egt_ColorRegistry' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egt_GraphModel', the role 'egt_GraphModel7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'egt_SingleEdge' and 'egt_SingleEdge'. From 'egt_SingleEdge', the role 'egt_SingleEdge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'egt_SingleEdge', the role 'egt_SingleEdge8' has cardinality 0..*.
