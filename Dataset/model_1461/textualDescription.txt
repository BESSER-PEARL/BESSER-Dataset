The class 'apromore_Event' is a specialization of 'Work'.
The class 'apromore_Message' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'apromore_Time' is a specialization of 'Event'.
The class 'apromore_Task' is a specialization of 'Work'.
The class 'apromore_Routing' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'apromore_Split' is a specialization of 'Routing'.
The class 'apromore_ORSplit' is a specialization of 'Split'.
The class 'apromore_XORSplit' is a specialization of 'Split'.
The class 'apromore_ANDSplit' is a specialization of 'Split'.
The class 'apromore_State' is a specialization of 'Routing'.
The class 'apromore_Join' is a specialization of 'Routing'.
The class 'apromore_ORJoin' is a specialization of 'Join'.
The class 'apromore_XORJoin' is a specialization of 'Join'.
The class 'apromore_ANDJoin' is a specialization of 'Join'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'apromore_Net' and 'apromore_CanonicalProcess'. From 'apromore_Net', the role 'apromore_Net' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_CanonicalProcess', the role 'apromore_CanonicalProcess' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'apromore_CanonicalProcess' and 'apromore_Net'. From 'apromore_CanonicalProcess', the role 'apromore_CanonicalProcess2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_Net', the role 'apromore_Net3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'apromore_Node' and 'apromore_Net'. From 'apromore_Node', the role 'apromore_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_Net', the role 'apromore_Net5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'apromore_Net' and 'apromore_Edge'. From 'apromore_Net', the role 'apromore_Net7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_Edge', the role 'apromore_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'apromore_Node' and 'apromore_Edge'. From 'apromore_Node', the role 'apromore_Node10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_Edge', the role 'apromore_Edge9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'apromore_Edge' and 'apromore_Node'. From 'apromore_Edge', the role 'apromore_Edge12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_Node', the role 'apromore_Node13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'apromore_Task' and 'apromore_Net'. From 'apromore_Task', the role 'apromore_Task' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'apromore_Net', the role 'apromore_Net15' has cardinality 0..*.
