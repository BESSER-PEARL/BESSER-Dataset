The class 'dependencies_Domain' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'dependencies_Required' is a specialization of 'Block'.
The class 'dependencies_SemiRequired' is a specialization of 'Block'.
The class 'dependencies_Create' is a specialization of 'Block'.
The class 'dependencies_Equivalence' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'dependencies_CoreClass' is a specialization of 'Vertex'.
The class 'dependencies_CoreClass' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'dependencies_SimpleTerm' is a specialization of 'Term'.
The class 'dependencies_RightTerm' is a specialization of 'Term'.
