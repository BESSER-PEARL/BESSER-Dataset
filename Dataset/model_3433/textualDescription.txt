Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'school_ClassGroup' and 'school_Student'. From 'school_ClassGroup', the role 'school_ClassGroup' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Teacher' and 'school_ClassGroup'. From 'school_Teacher', the role 'school_Teacher' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_ClassGroup', the role 'school_ClassGroup2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_ClassGroup' and 'school_ClassLevel'. From 'school_ClassGroup', the role 'school_ClassGroup4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_ClassLevel', the role 'school_ClassLevel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_ClassGroup' and 'school_Room'. From 'school_ClassGroup', the role 'school_ClassGroup6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Room', the role 'school_Room' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Teacher' and 'school_Room'. From 'school_Teacher', the role 'school_Teacher8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_Room', the role 'school_Room9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_SchoolYear' and 'school_ClassGroup'. From 'school_SchoolYear', the role 'school_SchoolYear' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_ClassGroup', the role 'school_ClassGroup11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_Student' and 'school_SchoolYear'. From 'school_Student', the role 'school_Student14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_SchoolYear', the role 'school_SchoolYear13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'school_ClassLevel' and 'school_SchoolYear'. From 'school_ClassLevel', the role 'school_ClassLevel17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'school_SchoolYear', the role 'school_SchoolYear16' has cardinality 0..*.
