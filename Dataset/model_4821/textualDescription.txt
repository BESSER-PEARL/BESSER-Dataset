The domain model 'typetranslation' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'typetranslation_MyClass' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'ecore_efloatobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eshortobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ediagnosticchain_multi', which is of type str; 'ocl_string_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_edoubleobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_elongobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eshortobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebiginteger_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eint_multi', which is of type int; 'ecore_etreeiterator_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eintegerobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eenumerator_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eint_single', which is of type int; 'ocl_integer_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eboolean_single', which is of type bool; 'ecore_ebooleanobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eresourceset_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ejavaobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_eresource_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ejavaobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_emap_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_edate_single', which is of type date; 'ecore_eshort_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_edoubleobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebyteobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebooleanobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_echaracterobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_efloat_single', which is of type float; 'ecore_etreeiterator_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ejavaclass_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_eresource_multi', which is of type str; 'ocl_boolean_single', which is of type str; 'ocl_real_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_edouble_multi', which is of type float; 'ecore_emap_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebiginteger_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_efeaturemap_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_eboolean_multi', which is of type bool; 'ecore_ebytearray_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eelist_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_elong_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_elong_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_efloat_multi', which is of type float; 'ecore_ebyteobject_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ediagnosticchain_single', which is of type str; 'ocl_boolean_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_efloatobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_efeaturemapentry_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_einvocationtargetexception_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_edouble_single', which is of type float; 'ocl_integer_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_efeaturemapentry_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eintegerobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_eenumerator_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_eresourceset_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebytearray_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_eshort_single', which is of type str; 'ocl_string_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebyte_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_efeaturemap_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebigdecimal_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_ejavaclass_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_estring_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_edate_multi', which is of type date; 'ocl_real_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_echar_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_echar_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_estring_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_elongobject_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_einvocationtargetexception_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebyte_multi', which is of type str; 'ecore_eelist_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_ebigdecimal_single', which is of type str; 'ecore_echaracterobject_single', which is of type str.

'typetranslation_AbstractClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MyEnumeration' is defined but does not specify any literals.
