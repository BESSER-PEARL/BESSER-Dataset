The domain model 'studyprogramme' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'studyprogramme_Programme' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'programmeType', which is of type str; 'programmeCode', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'numberOfYears', which is of type int.

'studyprogramme_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'semesterNumber', which is of type int.

'studyprogramme_University' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'SemesterContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'studyprogramme_CompulsoryCourseSlot' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'CourseSlot' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'studyprogramme_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'courseCode', which is of type str; 'level', which is of type int; 'displayedName', which is of type str; 'credits', which is of type float.

'studyprogramme_CourseSlot' represents an important domain concept.

'studyprogramme_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'selectionSemester', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ProgrammeCode' defines the following possible values: 'MTPROD', 'MTIOT', 'BIT', 'MIT', 'MTDT', 'MIDT'.
The enumeration 'ProgrammeType' defines the following possible values: 'Bachelors', 'Masters', 'IntegratedMaster'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'studyprogramme_Programme' is a specialization of 'SemesterContainer'.
The class 'studyprogramme_Specialization' is a specialization of 'SemesterContainer'.
The class 'studyprogramme_ElectiveCourseSlot' is a specialization of 'CourseSlot'.
The class 'studyprogramme_CompulsoryCourseSlot' is a specialization of 'CourseSlot'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'studyprogramme_Specialization' and 'studyprogramme_Programme'. From 'studyprogramme_Specialization', the role 'Specialization' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogramme_Programme', the role 'programme' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogramme_Specialization' and 'studyprogramme_Programme'. From 'studyprogramme_Specialization', the role 'specializations' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogramme_Programme', the role 'Programme' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studyprogramme_Specialization' and 'studyprogramme_Specialization'. From 'studyprogramme_Specialization', the role 'parrentSpecialisation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studyprogramme_Specialization', the role 'Specialization4' has cardinality 0..*.
