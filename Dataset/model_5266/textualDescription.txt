The domain model 'l1' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'l1_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'l1_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'l1_A' and 'l1_B'. From 'l1_A', the role 'l1_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'l1_B', the role 'l1_B' has cardinality 0..*.
