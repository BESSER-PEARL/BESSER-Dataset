Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'UnserializableEnumTest' defines the following possible values: 'name2', 'name1'.
The enumeration 'SerializableEnumTest' defines the following possible values: 'name4', 'name3'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'exhaustive_AbstractTest' is a specialization of 'OperationsTest'.
The class 'exhaustive_InterfaceTest' is a specialization of 'OperationsTest'.
The class 'exhaustive_MultipleSuperTest' is a specialization of 'AbstractTest'.
The class 'exhaustive_MultipleSuperTest' is a specialization of 'InterfaceTest'.
The class 'exhaustive_ReferencesTest' is a specialization of 'AbstractTest'.
The class 'exhaustive_AttributesTest' is a specialization of 'MultipleSuperTest'.
The class 'exhaustive_AttributesTest' is a specialization of 'InterfaceTest'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
