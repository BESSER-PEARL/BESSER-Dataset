'core_IntegerLiteral' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'val', which is of type int.

'core_Not' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'core_Add' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_UnaryExpression' is a specialization of 'IntegerExpression'.
The class 'core_And' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Or' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Not' is a specialization of 'UnaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Greater' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Lower' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_IntegerLiteral' is a specialization of 'IntegerExpression'.
The class 'core_Conditional' is a specialization of 'IntegerExpression'.
The class 'core_BinaryExpression' is a specialization of 'IntegerExpression'.
The class 'core_Mult' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Div' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Mod' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_UMinus' is a specialization of 'UnaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Minus' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.
The class 'core_Equal' is a specialization of 'BinaryExpression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'core_Rule' and 'core_IntegerExpression'. From 'core_Rule', the role 'core_Rule' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_Rule' and 'core_Filter'. From 'core_Rule', the role 'core_Rule2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_Filter', the role 'core_Filter' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_UnaryExpression' and 'core_IntegerExpression'. From 'core_UnaryExpression', the role 'core_UnaryExpression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_IntegerExpression' and 'core_Conditional'. From 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_Conditional', the role 'core_Conditional' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_Conditional' and 'core_IntegerExpression'. From 'core_Conditional', the role 'core_Conditional8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_Conditional' and 'core_IntegerExpression'. From 'core_Conditional', the role 'core_Conditional11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_IntegerExpression' and 'core_BinaryExpression'. From 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_BinaryExpression', the role 'core_BinaryExpression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'core_IntegerExpression' and 'core_BinaryExpression'. From 'core_IntegerExpression', the role 'core_IntegerExpression17' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'core_BinaryExpression', the role 'core_BinaryExpression16' has cardinality 0..*.
