The domain model 'myDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'myDsl_Plus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Mult' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Num' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'myDsl_Let' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'myDsl_Method' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDsl_Classs' represents an important domain concept.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Div' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_MathExp' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'myDsl_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl_Method' is a specialization of 'Instance'.
The class 'myDsl_MathExp' is a specialization of 'Instance'.
The class 'myDsl_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'myDsl_Minus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'myDsl_Mult' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'myDsl_Div' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'myDsl_Var' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'myDsl_Let' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'myDsl_Num' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
