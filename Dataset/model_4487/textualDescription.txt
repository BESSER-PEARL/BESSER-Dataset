The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 13 main class(es).

'model_OzobotProgram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Wait' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'time', which is of type int.

'Command' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Light' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'color', which is of type str.

'model_Block' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'model_Rotate' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'direction', which is of type str; 'velocity', which is of type str; 'angle', which is of type float.

'model_Move' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'distance', which is of type int; 'velocity', which is of type str.

'model_Repeat' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'count', which is of type int.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Ozobot' represents an important domain concept.

'model_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'message', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Velocity' defines the following possible values: 'slow', 'very_fast', 'very_slow', 'fast', 'medium'.
The enumeration 'Color' defines the following possible values: 'yellow', 'blue', 'green', 'none', 'red'.
The enumeration 'Direction' defines the following possible values: 'right', 'left'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_OzobotProgram' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'model_Command' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'model_Move' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'model_Light' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'model_Rotate' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'model_Wait' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'model_Repeat' is a specialization of 'Command'.
The class 'model_Ozobot' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'model_Block' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'model_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
