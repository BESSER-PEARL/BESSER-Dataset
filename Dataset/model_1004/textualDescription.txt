The domain model 'ZestGraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ZestGraph_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ZestGraph_GraphConnection' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'lineWidth', which is of type int; 'lineStyle', which is of type int; 'color', which is of type str.

'GraphItem' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ZestGraph_GraphItem' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'ZestGraph_GraphContainer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ZestGraph_GraphNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'backColor', which is of type str; 'nodeStyle', which is of type str; 'height', which is of type float; 'width', which is of type float; 'shape', which is of type str.

'ZestGraph_ZestGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'ZestGraph_GraphNode' is a specialization of 'GraphItem'.
The class 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection' is a specialization of 'GraphItem'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphItem' and 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphItem', the role 'GraphItem' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph', the role 'graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer' and 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer', the role 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph', the role 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer' and 'ZestGraph_GraphNode'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer', the role 'ZestGraph_GraphContainer3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_GraphNode', the role 'ZestGraph_GraphNode' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph' and 'ZestGraph_GraphItem'. From 'ZestGraph_ZestGraph', the role 'ZestGraph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_GraphItem', the role 'items' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection' and 'ZestGraph_GraphNode'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection', the role 'GraphConnection' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_GraphNode', the role 'sourceNode' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection' and 'ZestGraph_GraphNode'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection', the role 'GraphConnection7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_GraphNode', the role 'targetNode' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphNode' and 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphNode', the role 'GraphNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection', the role 'outgoing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection' and 'ZestGraph_GraphNode'. From 'ZestGraph_GraphConnection', the role 'ingoing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ZestGraph_GraphNode', the role 'GraphNode10' has cardinality 0..*.
