'fsm_Join' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'initialTime', which is of type int; 'finalTime', which is of type int.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsm_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsm_TimedTransition' is a specialization of 'Transition'.
The class 'fsm_Pseudostate' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fsm_Fork' is a specialization of 'Pseudostate'.
The class 'fsm_Join' is a specialization of 'Pseudostate'.
The class 'fsm_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_StateMachine' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_StateMachine', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_StateMachine' and 'fsm_Transition'. From 'fsm_StateMachine', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Transition', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_State' and 'fsm_StateMachine'. From 'fsm_State', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_StateMachine', the role '13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_CompositeState' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_CompositeState', the role 'fsm_CompositeState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
