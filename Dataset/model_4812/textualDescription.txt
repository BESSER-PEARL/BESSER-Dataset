The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'trip_model_OtherService' is a specialization of 'Service'.
The class 'trip_model_TravelService' is a specialization of 'Service'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'trip_model_location' and 'trip_model_OtherService'. From 'trip_model_location', the role 'trip_model_location' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trip_model_OtherService', the role 'trip_model_OtherService' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trip_model_location' and 'trip_model_TravelService'. From 'trip_model_location', the role 'trip_model_location2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trip_model_TravelService', the role 'trip_model_TravelService' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'trip_model_location' and 'trip_model_TravelService'. From 'trip_model_location', the role 'trip_model_location5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'trip_model_TravelService', the role 'trip_model_TravelService4' has cardinality 0..*.
