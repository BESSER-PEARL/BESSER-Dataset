The domain model 'OO' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 24 main class(es).

'OO_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'OO_ExternalClass' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'OO_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'OO_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isAbstract', which is of type str.

'OO_Package' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'OO_PackageableElement' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VisibilityEnum' defines the following possible values: 'private', 'public'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'OO_Model' is a specialization of 'Package'.
The class 'OO_PackageableElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'OO_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'AnnotatedElement'.
The class 'OO_Package' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.
The class 'OO_Classifier' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.
The class 'OO_ExternalClass' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'OO_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'OO_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'OO_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'OO_StructuralFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'OO_Operation' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'OO_Parameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'OO_Reference' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.
The class 'OO_Attribute' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'OO_PackageableElement' and 'OO_Package'. From 'OO_PackageableElement', the role 'contents' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OO_Package', the role 'Package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'OO_AnnotatedElement' and 'OO_Annotation'. From 'OO_AnnotatedElement', the role 'OO_AnnotatedElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OO_Annotation', the role 'OO_Annotation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'OO_PackageableElement' and 'OO_Package'. From 'OO_PackageableElement', the role 'PackageableElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OO_Package', the role 'package' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'OO_Class' and 'OO_Class'. From 'OO_Class', the role 'extendedBy' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OO_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'OO_Class' and 'OO_Class'. From 'OO_Class', the role 'Class7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OO_Class', the role 'extends' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'OO_Feature' and 'OO_Class'. From 'OO_Feature', the role 'Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'OO_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*.
