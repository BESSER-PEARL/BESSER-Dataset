The domain model 'study' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'study_StudyPlan' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'study_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'points', which is of type float; 'code', which is of type str.

'study_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semesterNumber', which is of type int; 'fallOrSpring', which is of type str.

'study_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'study_Programme' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'programmeCode', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'study_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'study_CourseSlot' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'elective', which is of type bool.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'programmeCode' defines the following possible values: 'Datateknologi2', 'Informatikk', 'Datateknologi5'.
The enumeration 'FallOrSpring' defines the following possible values: 'Spring', 'Fall'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'study_Department' and 'study_Programme'. From 'study_Department', the role 'study_Department' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'study_Programme', the role 'study_Programme' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'study_Course' and 'study_Department'. From 'study_Course', the role 'study_Course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'study_Department', the role 'study_Department2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'study_StudyPlan' and 'study_Programme'. From 'study_StudyPlan', the role 'study_StudyPlan' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'study_Programme', the role 'study_Programme4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'study_StudyPlan' and 'study_Specialization'. From 'study_StudyPlan', the role 'study_StudyPlan6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'study_Specialization', the role 'study_Specialization' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'study_StudyPlan' and 'study_Semester'. From 'study_StudyPlan', the role 'study_StudyPlan8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'study_Semester', the role 'study_Semester' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'study_Semester' and 'study_Specialization'. From 'study_Semester', the role 'study_Semester11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'study_Specialization', the role 'study_Specialization10' has cardinality 0..*.
