The domain model 'graph2' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'GraphComponent' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph2_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph2_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph2_GraphComponent' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'graph2_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graph2_Node' is a specialization of 'GraphComponent'.
The class 'graph2_Edge' is a specialization of 'GraphComponent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph2_Node' and 'graph2_Edge'. From 'graph2_Node', the role 'graph2_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph2_Edge', the role 'graph2_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph2_Node' and 'graph2_Edge'. From 'graph2_Node', the role 'graph2_Node3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph2_Edge', the role 'graph2_Edge2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph2_GraphComponent' and 'graph2_Graph'. From 'graph2_GraphComponent', the role 'graph2_GraphComponent' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph2_Graph', the role 'graph2_Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
