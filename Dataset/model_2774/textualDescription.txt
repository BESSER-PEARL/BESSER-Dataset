The class 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD' is a specialization of 'ChildContaineeD'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD' and 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildC'. From 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD', the role 'ChildD' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildC', the role 'c' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD' and 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildC'. From 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD', the role 'd' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildC', the role 'ChildC' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD' and 'MetamodelInheritance3_BaseContaineeA'. From 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD', the role 'MetamodelInheritance3_ChildD' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MetamodelInheritance3_BaseContaineeA', the role 'MetamodelInheritance3_BaseContaineeA' has cardinality 0..*.
