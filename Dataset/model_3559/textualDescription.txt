The domain model 'simpleimperative' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'simpleimperative_VarDecl' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simpleimperative_Loop' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleimperative_Assignation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleimperative_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleimperative_Print' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleimperative_Wait' represents an important domain concept.

'Statement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleimperative_ConsoleOutput' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'input', which is of type str.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleimperative_VarRef' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'varRef', which is of type str.

'simpleimperative_Expression' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simpleimperative_Conditional' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'simpleimperative_Loop' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'simpleimperative_VarDecl' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'simpleimperative_Assignation' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'simpleimperative_VarRef' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'simpleimperative_ConsoleOutput' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'simpleimperative_Println' is a specialization of 'ConsoleOutput'.
The class 'simpleimperative_Print' is a specialization of 'ConsoleOutput'.
The class 'simpleimperative_Wait' is a specialization of 'Statement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_Program' and 'simpleimperative_Statement'. From 'simpleimperative_Program', the role 'simpleimperative_Program' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Statement', the role 'simpleimperative_Statement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_Conditional' and 'simpleimperative_Expression'. From 'simpleimperative_Conditional', the role 'simpleimperative_Conditional' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Expression', the role 'simpleimperative_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_Statement' and 'simpleimperative_Conditional'. From 'simpleimperative_Statement', the role 'simpleimperative_Statement4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Conditional', the role 'simpleimperative_Conditional3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_Loop' and 'simpleimperative_Expression'. From 'simpleimperative_Loop', the role 'simpleimperative_Loop' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Expression', the role 'simpleimperative_Expression6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_Statement' and 'simpleimperative_Loop'. From 'simpleimperative_Statement', the role 'simpleimperative_Statement9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Loop', the role 'simpleimperative_Loop8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_VarDecl' and 'simpleimperative_Expression'. From 'simpleimperative_VarDecl', the role 'simpleimperative_VarDecl' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Expression', the role 'simpleimperative_Expression11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_VarDecl' and 'simpleimperative_Assignation'. From 'simpleimperative_VarDecl', the role 'simpleimperative_VarDecl13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Assignation', the role 'simpleimperative_Assignation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleimperative_Expression' and 'simpleimperative_Assignation'. From 'simpleimperative_Expression', the role 'simpleimperative_Expression16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleimperative_Assignation', the role 'simpleimperative_Assignation15' has cardinality 0..*.
