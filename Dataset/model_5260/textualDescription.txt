The enumeration 'StyleKey' defines the following possible values: 'textAlign', 'backgroundColor', 'padding', 'textDecoration', 'display', 'color', 'lineHeight', 'width'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'HTML_TABLE' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_TR' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_TD' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_DIV' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_SPAN' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_P' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_A' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_FONT' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_B' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_U' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_I' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_S' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_IMG' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_BR' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.
The class 'HTML_HR' is a specialization of 'HTMLElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'HTML_HTML' and 'HTML_HTMLElement'. From 'HTML_HTML', the role 'HTML_HTML' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HTML_HTMLElement', the role 'HTML_HTMLElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HTML_HTMLElement' and 'HTML_HTMLElement'. From 'HTML_HTMLElement', the role 'HTML_HTMLElement3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HTML_HTMLElement', the role 'HTML_HTMLElement1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HTML_Style' and 'HTML_HTMLElement'. From 'HTML_Style', the role 'HTML_Style' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HTML_HTMLElement', the role 'HTML_HTMLElement5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HTML_TABLE' and 'HTML_TR'. From 'HTML_TABLE', the role 'HTML_TABLE' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HTML_TR', the role 'HTML_TR' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HTML_TR' and 'HTML_TD'. From 'HTML_TR', the role 'HTML_TR8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HTML_TD', the role 'HTML_TD' has cardinality 0..*.
