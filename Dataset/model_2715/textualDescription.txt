The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'errorkref_A' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'errorkref_D' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'errorkref_E' is a specialization of 'D'.
The class 'errorkref_F' is a specialization of 'E'.
The class 'errorkref_G' is a specialization of 'M'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'errorkref_A' and 'errorkref_C'. From 'errorkref_A', the role 'errorkref_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_C', the role 'errorkref_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorkref_C' and 'errorkref_D'. From 'errorkref_C', the role 'errorkref_C2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_D', the role 'errorkref_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorkref_C' and 'errorkref_L1'. From 'errorkref_C', the role 'errorkref_C4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_L1', the role 'errorkref_L1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorkref_A' and 'errorkref_B'. From 'errorkref_A', the role 'errorkref_A6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_B', the role 'errorkref_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorkref_B' and 'errorkref_G'. From 'errorkref_B', the role 'errorkref_B8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_G', the role 'errorkref_G' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorkref_D' and 'errorkref_F'. From 'errorkref_D', the role 'errorkref_D10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_F', the role 'errorkref_F' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'errorkref_D' and 'errorkref_G'. From 'errorkref_D', the role 'errorkref_D12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'errorkref_G', the role 'errorkref_G13' has cardinality 0..*.
