The domain model 'schul' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'schul_Classroom' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'schul_School' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'schul_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'schul_Classroom' and 'schul_Student'. From 'schul_Classroom', the role 'schul_Classroom' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schul_Student', the role 'schul_Student' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'schul_Diagram' and 'schul_School'. From 'schul_Diagram', the role 'schul_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schul_School', the role 'schul_School' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'schul_Classroom' and 'schul_School'. From 'schul_Classroom', the role 'schul_Classroom4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schul_School', the role 'schul_School3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'schul_Student' and 'schul_Student'. From 'schul_Student', the role 'schul_Student5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schul_Student', the role 'schul_Student7' has cardinality 0..*.
