Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'RelationalOperator' defines the following possible values: 'greaterThanOrEqualTo', 'equals', 'lessThan', 'greaterThan', 'lessThanOrEqualTo', 'notEqual'.
The enumeration 'ArithmeticOperator' defines the following possible values: 'plus', 'div', 'minus', 'mult'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'kmLogo_VarDecl' is a specialization of 'Instruction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'kmLogo_VarDecl' and 'kmLogo_LogoProgram'. From 'kmLogo_VarDecl', the role 'kmLogo_VarDecl' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kmLogo_LogoProgram', the role 'kmLogo_LogoProgram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kmLogo_LogoProgram' and 'kmLogo_Instruction'. From 'kmLogo_LogoProgram', the role 'kmLogo_LogoProgram2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kmLogo_Instruction', the role 'kmLogo_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kmLogo_Back' and 'kmLogo_Expression'. From 'kmLogo_Back', the role 'kmLogo_Back' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kmLogo_Expression', the role 'kmLogo_Expression' has cardinality 0..*.
