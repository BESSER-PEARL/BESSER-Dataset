'simpleTG_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleTG_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleTG_Container' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simpleTG_A' and 'simpleTG_Container'. From 'simpleTG_A', the role 'simpleTG_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleTG_Container', the role 'simpleTG_Container' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleTG_Container' and 'simpleTG_B'. From 'simpleTG_Container', the role 'simpleTG_Container2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleTG_B', the role 'simpleTG_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleTG_Container' and 'simpleTG_C'. From 'simpleTG_Container', the role 'simpleTG_Container4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleTG_C', the role 'simpleTG_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simpleTG_A' and 'simpleTG_B'. From 'simpleTG_A', the role 'simpleTG_A6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simpleTG_B', the role 'simpleTG_B7' has cardinality 0..*.
