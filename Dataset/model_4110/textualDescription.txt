The class 'wh_ExprOr' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprCons' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprList' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprHd' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprTl' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprSym' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprNot' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
The class 'wh_ExprEq' is a specialization of 'Expr'.
