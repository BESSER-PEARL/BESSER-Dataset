Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MultiplicityKind' defines the following possible values: 'Single', 'Multiple'.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'Date', 'Integer', 'String'.
The enumeration 'ButtonKind' defines the following possible values: 'delete', 'cancel', 'createEdit'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl01_Attribute' is a specialization of 'Property'.
The class 'myDsl01_Reference' is a specialization of 'Property'.
The class 'myDsl01_ListWindow' is a specialization of 'Window'.
The class 'myDsl01_EntryWindow' is a specialization of 'Window'.
The class 'myDsl01_Label' is a specialization of 'UIElement'.
The class 'myDsl01_Field' is a specialization of 'UIElement'.
The class 'myDsl01_Button' is a specialization of 'UIElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl01_Entity' and 'myDsl01_Model'. From 'myDsl01_Entity', the role 'myDsl01_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl01_Model', the role 'myDsl01_Model' has cardinality 0..*.
