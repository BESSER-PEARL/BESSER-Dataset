The domain model 'StateMachine' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'StateMachine_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'trigger', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type int.

'StateMachine_WashingMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachine_NamedState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'StateMachine_UnNamedState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'StateMachine_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'StateMachine_NamedState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'StateMachine_UnNamedState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'StateMachine_Transition' and 'StateMachine_State'. From 'StateMachine_Transition', the role 'StateMachine_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachine_State', the role 'StateMachine_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachine_State' and 'StateMachine_Transition'. From 'StateMachine_State', the role 'StateMachine_State3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachine_Transition', the role 'StateMachine_Transition2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachine_State' and 'StateMachine_Transition'. From 'StateMachine_State', the role 'StateMachine_State6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachine_Transition', the role 'StateMachine_Transition5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachine_WashingMachine' and 'StateMachine_State'. From 'StateMachine_WashingMachine', the role 'StateMachine_WashingMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachine_State', the role 'StateMachine_State8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'StateMachine_Transition' and 'StateMachine_WashingMachine'. From 'StateMachine_Transition', the role 'StateMachine_Transition11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'StateMachine_WashingMachine', the role 'StateMachine_WashingMachine10' has cardinality 0..*.
