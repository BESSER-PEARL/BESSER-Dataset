The domain model 'soa' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 19 main class(es).

'soa_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'soa_EntitiesFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'soa_Exception' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'msg', which is of type str.

'soa_GenericListFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'soa_Module' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'version', which is of type str; 'event', which is of type str.

'Entities' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'soa_Exceptions' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PrimitiveType' defines the following possible values: 'Timestamp', 'Decimal', 'Float', 'Boolean', 'Byte', 'Short', 'Integer', 'Datetime', 'String', 'Long', 'Date', 'Double'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'soa_Enum' is a specialization of 'Entities'.
The class 'soa_Entity' is a specialization of 'Entities'.
The class 'soa_EntitiesFeature' is a specialization of 'FeatureType'.
The class 'soa_PrimitiveFeature' is a specialization of 'FeatureType'.
The class 'soa_GenericListFeature' is a specialization of 'FeatureType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'soa_Architecture' and 'soa_Module'. From 'soa_Architecture', the role 'soa_Architecture' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'soa_Module', the role 'soa_Module' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'soa_Import' and 'soa_Module'. From 'soa_Import', the role 'soa_Import' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'soa_Module', the role 'soa_Module2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'soa_Model' and 'soa_Module'. From 'soa_Model', the role 'soa_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'soa_Module', the role 'soa_Module4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'soa_Exceptions' and 'soa_Module'. From 'soa_Exceptions', the role 'soa_Exceptions' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'soa_Module', the role 'soa_Module6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'soa_Module' and 'soa_Service'. From 'soa_Module', the role 'soa_Module8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'soa_Service', the role 'soa_Service' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'soa_Model' and 'soa_Entities'. From 'soa_Model', the role 'soa_Model10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'soa_Entities', the role 'soa_Entities' has cardinality 0..*.
