The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'dDL_Create_table' is a specialization of 'Definition'.
The class 'dDL_Alter_table' is a specialization of 'Definition'.
The class 'dDL_Comment' is a specialization of 'Definition'.
The class 'dDL_Create_sequence' is a specialization of 'Definition'.
The class 'dDL_Primary_key' is a specialization of 'Key'.
The class 'dDL_Unique_key' is a specialization of 'Key'.
The class 'dDL_Foreign_key' is a specialization of 'Key'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dDL_Definition' and 'dDL_Data_definition'. From 'dDL_Definition', the role 'dDL_Definition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dDL_Data_definition', the role 'dDL_Data_definition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dDL_Create_table' and 'dDL_Column'. From 'dDL_Create_table', the role 'dDL_Create_table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dDL_Column', the role 'dDL_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dDL_Create_table' and 'dDL_Constraint'. From 'dDL_Create_table', the role 'dDL_Create_table3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dDL_Constraint', the role 'dDL_Constraint' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dDL_TYPE' and 'dDL_Column'. From 'dDL_TYPE', the role 'dDL_TYPE' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dDL_Column', the role 'dDL_Column5' has cardinality 0..*.
