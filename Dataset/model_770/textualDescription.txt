Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UML2_Feature' and 'UML2_Classifier'. From 'UML2_Feature', the role 'UML2_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_Classifier', the role 'UML2_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_StructuralFeature' and 'UML2_StructuralFeatureAction'. From 'UML2_StructuralFeature', the role 'UML2_StructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_StructuralFeatureAction', the role 'UML2_StructuralFeatureAction' has cardinality 0..*.
