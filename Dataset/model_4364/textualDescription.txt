The domain model 'design' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'design_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'accessModifier', which is of type str.

'design_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'design_Aggregation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Generalization' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'returnType', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'design_Composition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Realization' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Dependency' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'design_Design' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'language', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AccessModifiers' defines the following possible values: 'private', 'protected', 'public'.
The enumeration 'Types' defines the following possible values: 'int', 'boolean', 'float', 'void', 'double', 'long', 'string'.
The enumeration 'Languages' defines the following possible values: 'CS', 'CPP', 'Java', 'Python'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'design_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'design_Association' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'design_Generalization' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'design_Dependency' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'design_Composition' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'design_Aggregation' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'design_Realization' is a specialization of 'Relation'.
The class 'design_Interface' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'design_Classifier' and 'design_Design'. From 'design_Classifier', the role 'design_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'design_Design', the role 'design_Design' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'design_Design' and 'design_Relation'. From 'design_Design', the role 'design_Design2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'design_Relation', the role 'design_Relation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'design_Relation' and 'design_Classifier'. From 'design_Relation', the role 'design_Relation4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'design_Classifier', the role 'design_Classifier5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'design_Classifier' and 'design_Relation'. From 'design_Classifier', the role 'design_Classifier8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'design_Relation', the role 'design_Relation7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'design_Classifier' and 'design_Attribute'. From 'design_Classifier', the role 'design_Classifier10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'design_Attribute', the role 'design_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'design_Classifier' and 'design_Operation'. From 'design_Classifier', the role 'design_Classifier12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'design_Operation', the role 'design_Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
