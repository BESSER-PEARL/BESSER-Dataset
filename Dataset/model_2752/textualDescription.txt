The domain model 'test' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'test_Compo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test_Compo' and 'test_B'. From 'test_Compo', the role 'test_Compo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_B', the role 'test_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_A' and 'test_Compo'. From 'test_A', the role 'test_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_Compo', the role 'test_Compo2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'test_A' and 'test_B'. From 'test_A', the role 'test_A4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test_B', the role 'test_B5' has cardinality 0..*.
