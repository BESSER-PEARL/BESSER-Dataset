Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'bibtex_BibTeXFile' and 'bibtex_BibTeXEntry'. From 'bibtex_BibTeXFile', the role 'bibtex_BibTeXFile' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bibtex_BibTeXEntry', the role 'bibtex_BibTeXEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bibtex_Author' and 'bibtex_AuthoredEntry'. From 'bibtex_Author', the role 'bibtex_Author' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bibtex_AuthoredEntry', the role 'bibtex_AuthoredEntry' has cardinality 0..*.
