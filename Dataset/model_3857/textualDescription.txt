The domain model 'SimpleRDBMS' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'SimpleRDBMS_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'SimpleRDBMS_FKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SimpleRDBMS_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'type', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type int.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SimpleRDBMS_Table' and 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey'. From 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleRDBMS_Table' and 'SimpleRDBMS_Column'. From 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_Column', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleRDBMS_Table' and 'SimpleRDBMS_Column'. From 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_Column', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Column5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey' and 'SimpleRDBMS_Table'. From 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_Table', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Table8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SimpleRDBMS_Column' and 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey'. From 'SimpleRDBMS_Column', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_Column11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey', the role 'SimpleRDBMS_FKey10' has cardinality 0..*.
