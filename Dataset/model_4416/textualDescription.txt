Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'OperatorKind' defines the following possible values: 'notEqual', 'lowerOrEqual', 'equal', 'upperOrEqual'.
The enumeration 'Color' defines the following possible values: 'BROWN', 'YELLOW', 'RED', 'LIGHT_GRAY', 'GREEN', 'MAGENTA', 'WHITE', 'CYAN', 'PINK', 'BLACK', 'GRAY', 'DARK_GRAY', 'ORANGE', 'NONE', 'BLUE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Instruction' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'previous' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'Instruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Instruction' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'next' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'Instruction4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Flow' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_Flow', the role 'mindstorms_Flow' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Flow' and 'mindstorms_Instruction'. From 'mindstorms_Flow', the role 'mindstorms_Flow7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Instruction', the role 'mindstorms_Instruction8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mindstorms_Reuse' and 'mindstorms_Choregraphy'. From 'mindstorms_Reuse', the role 'mindstorms_Reuse' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mindstorms_Choregraphy', the role 'mindstorms_Choregraphy' has cardinality 0..*.
