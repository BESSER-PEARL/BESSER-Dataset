The domain model 'MM1' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MM1_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'MM1_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MM1_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type bool.

'MM1_ContainerMM1' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'aname', which is of type int.

'MM1_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'MM1_B' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'MM1_C' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'MM1_ContainerMM1' and 'MM1_A'. From 'MM1_ContainerMM1', the role 'MM1_ContainerMM1' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MM1_A', the role 'MM1_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MM1_D' and 'MM1_ContainerMM1'. From 'MM1_D', the role 'MM1_D' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MM1_ContainerMM1', the role 'MM1_ContainerMM12' has cardinality 0..*.
