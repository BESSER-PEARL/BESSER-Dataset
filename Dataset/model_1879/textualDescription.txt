The class 'budgeting_IncomeCategory' is a specialization of 'Category'.
The class 'budgeting_ExpenseCategory' is a specialization of 'Category'.
The class 'budgeting_BudgetAmountEntry' is a specialization of 'BudgetEntry'.
The class 'budgeting_BudgetFactorEntry' is a specialization of 'BudgetEntry'.
The class 'budgeting_ActualAmountEntry' is a specialization of 'ActualEntry'.
The class 'budgeting_ActualTransactionEntry' is a specialization of 'ActualEntry'.
The class 'budgeting_CashTransaction' is a specialization of 'Transaction'.
The class 'budgeting_CardTransaction' is a specialization of 'Transaction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
