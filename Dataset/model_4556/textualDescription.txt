The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'platoon_LeadVehicle' is a specialization of 'Vehicle'.
The class 'platoon_FollowVehicle' is a specialization of 'Vehicle'.
The class 'platoon_Forward' is a specialization of 'Step'.
The class 'platoon_Turn' is a specialization of 'Step'.
The class 'platoon_TurnLeft' is a specialization of 'Turn'.
The class 'platoon_TurnRight' is a specialization of 'Turn'.
The class 'platoon_headway' is a specialization of 'Constraint'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'platoon_Platoon' and 'platoon_World'. From 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_World', the role 'platoon_World' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Route' and 'platoon_World'. From 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_World', the role 'platoon_World2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Constraints' and 'platoon_World'. From 'platoon_Constraints', the role 'platoon_Constraints' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_World', the role 'platoon_World4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_LeadVehicle' and 'platoon_Platoon'. From 'platoon_LeadVehicle', the role 'platoon_LeadVehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_FollowVehicle' and 'platoon_Platoon'. From 'platoon_FollowVehicle', the role 'platoon_FollowVehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Platoon', the role 'platoon_Platoon8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_LeadVehicle' and 'platoon_Route'. From 'platoon_LeadVehicle', the role 'platoon_LeadVehicle10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_Route', the role 'platoon_Route11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'platoon_Vehicle' and 'platoon_FollowVehicle'. From 'platoon_Vehicle', the role 'platoon_Vehicle' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'platoon_FollowVehicle', the role 'platoon_FollowVehicle13' has cardinality 0..*.
