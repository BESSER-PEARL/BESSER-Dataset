Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'NodeFigure' defines the following possible values: 'Rectangle', 'Rounded', 'Image', 'Default', 'Ellipse', 'Polygon', 'SVG'.
The enumeration 'Brightness' defines the following possible values: 'Default', 'Light', 'Dark'.
The enumeration 'LayoutCompartment' defines the following possible values: 'Free', 'List'.
The enumeration 'Placement' defines the following possible values: 'External', 'None', 'Internal'.
The enumeration 'Texture' defines the following possible values: 'Dot', 'Default', 'Solid', 'Dash'.
The enumeration 'LinkFigure' defines the following possible values: 'FilledClosedArrow', 'FilledRhomb', 'Arrow', 'Square', 'FilledSquare', 'Default', 'Rhomb', 'None', 'ClosedArrow'.
The enumeration 'FontStyle' defines the following possible values: 'Default', 'Bold', 'Italic'.
The enumeration 'Color' defines the following possible values: 'Cyan', 'Black', 'Gray', 'Default', 'Green', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'White', 'Orange', 'Blue'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'cevinedit_NodeEClass' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.
The class 'cevinedit_LinkEClass' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.
The class 'cevinedit_LinkEClass' is a specialization of 'Link'.
The class 'cevinedit_CompartmentEReferenceCont' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.
The class 'cevinedit_AffixedEReferenceCont' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.
The class 'cevinedit_LabelEAttribute' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.
The class 'cevinedit_LinkEReferenceNonCont' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.
The class 'cevinedit_LinkEReferenceNonCont' is a specialization of 'Link'.
The class 'cevinedit_Link' is a specialization of 'PersonalizedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'cevinedit_Diagram' and 'cevinedit_CEViNEditRoot'. From 'cevinedit_Diagram', the role 'cevinedit_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cevinedit_CEViNEditRoot', the role 'cevinedit_CEViNEditRoot' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cevinedit_Diagram' and 'cevinedit_PersonalizedElement'. From 'cevinedit_Diagram', the role 'cevinedit_Diagram2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cevinedit_PersonalizedElement', the role 'cevinedit_PersonalizedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
