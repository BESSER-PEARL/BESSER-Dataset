The domain model 'tinylibrary' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Person' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tinylibrary_Employee' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tinylibrary_Person' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'firstName', which is of type str; 'lastName', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'tinylibrary_Writer' is a specialization of 'Person'.
The class 'tinylibrary_Employee' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tinylibrary_Library' and 'tinylibrary_Book'. From 'tinylibrary_Library', the role 'tinylibrary_Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tinylibrary_Book', the role 'tinylibrary_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tinylibrary_Library' and 'tinylibrary_Employee'. From 'tinylibrary_Library', the role 'tinylibrary_Library2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tinylibrary_Employee', the role 'tinylibrary_Employee' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tinylibrary_Writer' and 'tinylibrary_Library'. From 'tinylibrary_Writer', the role 'tinylibrary_Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tinylibrary_Library', the role 'tinylibrary_Library4' has cardinality 0..*.
