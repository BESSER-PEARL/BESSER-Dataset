The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'message_MessageLibrary' is a specialization of 'Categorized'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'message_MessageLibrary' and 'message_Message'. From 'message_MessageLibrary', the role 'message_MessageLibrary' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'message_Message', the role 'message_Message' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'message_Translation' and 'message_Message'. From 'message_Translation', the role 'message_Translation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'message_Message', the role 'message_Message2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'message_Language' and 'message_Translation'. From 'message_Language', the role 'message_Language' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'message_Translation', the role 'message_Translation4' has cardinality 0..*.
