The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Element' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'PetriNet_TransitionToPlace' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Element' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'Element' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'net' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNet' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'net2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Element' and 'PetriNet_PetriNet'. From 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_PetriNet', the role 'PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_TransitionToPlace' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_TransitionToPlace', the role 'TransitionToPlace' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' and 'PetriNet_Place'. From 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition', the role 'PlaceToTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Place', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*.
