The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'DBLP_Article' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_Book' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_InCollection' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_InProceedings' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_MastersThesis' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_Proceedings' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_PhDThesis' is a specialization of 'Record'.
The class 'DBLP_Www' is a specialization of 'Record'.
