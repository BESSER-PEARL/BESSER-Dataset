The domain model 'pDL2' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'pDL2_Guidance' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'texte', which is of type str.

'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindFinish' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Finished2Start', which is of type str; 'Finished2Finish', which is of type str.

'pDL2_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pDL2_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pDL2_ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindStart' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'Started2Start', which is of type str; 'Started2Finish', which is of type str.

'pDL2_DependanceFinish' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pDL2_DependanceStart' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'pDL2_WorkDefinition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'pDL2_WorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'pDL2_Guidance' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pDL2_Process' and 'pDL2_ProcessElement'. From 'pDL2_Process', the role 'pDL2_Process' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pDL2_ProcessElement', the role 'pDL2_ProcessElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pDL2_WorkDefinition' and 'pDL2_EObject'. From 'pDL2_WorkDefinition', the role 'pDL2_WorkDefinition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pDL2_EObject', the role 'pDL2_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pDL2_DependanceStart' and 'pDL2_WorkDefinition'. From 'pDL2_DependanceStart', the role 'pDL2_DependanceStart' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pDL2_WorkDefinition', the role 'pDL2_WorkDefinition3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pDL2_DependanceStart' and 'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindStart'. From 'pDL2_DependanceStart', the role 'pDL2_DependanceStart5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindStart', the role 'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindStart' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pDL2_DependanceFinish' and 'pDL2_WorkDefinition'. From 'pDL2_DependanceFinish', the role 'pDL2_DependanceFinish' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pDL2_WorkDefinition', the role 'pDL2_WorkDefinition7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pDL2_DependanceFinish' and 'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindFinish'. From 'pDL2_DependanceFinish', the role 'pDL2_DependanceFinish9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindFinish', the role 'pDL2_WorkSequenceKindFinish' has cardinality 0..*.
