The domain model 'mathDSL' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'mathDSL_Multi' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathDSL_Plus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathDSL_Div' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathDSL_NumberLiteral' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathDSL_Minus' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathDSL_Math' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'mathDSL_Expression' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'mathDSL_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathDSL_Minus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathDSL_Multi' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathDSL_Div' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'mathDSL_NumberLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'mathDSL_Expression' and 'mathDSL_Math'. From 'mathDSL_Expression', the role 'mathDSL_Expression' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathDSL_Math', the role 'mathDSL_Math' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathDSL_Expression' and 'mathDSL_Plus'. From 'mathDSL_Expression', the role 'mathDSL_Expression2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathDSL_Plus', the role 'mathDSL_Plus' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathDSL_Plus' and 'mathDSL_Expression'. From 'mathDSL_Plus', the role 'mathDSL_Plus4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathDSL_Expression', the role 'mathDSL_Expression5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathDSL_Minus' and 'mathDSL_Expression'. From 'mathDSL_Minus', the role 'mathDSL_Minus' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathDSL_Expression', the role 'mathDSL_Expression7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'mathDSL_Minus' and 'mathDSL_Expression'. From 'mathDSL_Minus', the role 'mathDSL_Minus9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'mathDSL_Expression', the role 'mathDSL_Expression10' has cardinality 0..*.
