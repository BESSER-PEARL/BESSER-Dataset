Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ESeverity' defines the following possible values: 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'.
The enumeration 'EAttackMethod' defines the following possible values: 'SQLInjection', 'XSS', 'Authentication', 'PrivilegeScalation', 'Authorization'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'securityTest_TargetOfEvaluation' and 'securityTest_Test'. From 'securityTest_TargetOfEvaluation', the role 'securityTest_TargetOfEvaluation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'securityTest_Test', the role 'securityTest_Test' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'securityTest_Test' and 'securityTest_Attack'. From 'securityTest_Test', the role 'securityTest_Test2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'securityTest_Attack', the role 'securityTest_Attack' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'securityTest_Note' and 'securityTest_Test'. From 'securityTest_Note', the role 'securityTest_Note' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'securityTest_Test', the role 'securityTest_Test4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'securityTest_Test' and 'securityTest_AuthSetting'. From 'securityTest_Test', the role 'securityTest_Test6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'securityTest_AuthSetting', the role 'securityTest_AuthSetting' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'securityTest_TargetOfEvaluation' and 'securityTest_WebComponent'. From 'securityTest_TargetOfEvaluation', the role 'securityTest_TargetOfEvaluation8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'securityTest_WebComponent', the role 'securityTest_WebComponent' has cardinality 0..*.
