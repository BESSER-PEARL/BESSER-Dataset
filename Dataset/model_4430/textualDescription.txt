Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SuccessState' defines the following possible values: 'Running', 'Success', 'Failure'.
The enumeration 'RunningState' defines the following possible values: 'Success', 'Failure', 'Running'.
The enumeration 'LightStatus' defines the following possible values: 'On', 'Off'.
The enumeration 'BumperKind' defines the following possible values: 'Right', 'Left'.
The enumeration 'FailureState' defines the following possible values: 'Failure', 'Success', 'Running'.
The enumeration 'DistanceKind' defines the following possible values: 'Minor', 'Major'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'gyro_Behavior' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'gyro_Priority' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'gyro_Parallel' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'gyro_Sequential' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'gyro_StatusChange' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
The class 'gyro_Action' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'gyro_Condition' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'gyro_Distance' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'gyro_Bumpers' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'gyro_Waiting' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'gyro_Actuate' is a specialization of 'Action'.
The class 'gyro_Motor' is a specialization of 'Actuate'.
The class 'gyro_Servo' is a specialization of 'Actuate'.
The class 'gyro_LED' is a specialization of 'Actuate'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'gyro_GyroSpecification' and 'gyro_Node'. From 'gyro_GyroSpecification', the role 'gyro_GyroSpecification' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_Node', the role 'gyro_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gyro_GyroSpecification' and 'gyro_Child'. From 'gyro_GyroSpecification', the role 'gyro_GyroSpecification2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_Child', the role 'gyro_Child' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gyro_Sibling' and 'gyro_GyroSpecification'. From 'gyro_Sibling', the role 'gyro_Sibling' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_GyroSpecification', the role 'gyro_GyroSpecification4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gyro_Behavior' and 'gyro_Child'. From 'gyro_Behavior', the role 'gyro_Behavior' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_Child', the role 'gyro_Child6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gyro_Node' and 'gyro_Child'. From 'gyro_Node', the role 'gyro_Node9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_Child', the role 'gyro_Child8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gyro_Node' and 'gyro_Sibling'. From 'gyro_Node', the role 'gyro_Node12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_Sibling', the role 'gyro_Sibling11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'gyro_Node' and 'gyro_Sibling'. From 'gyro_Node', the role 'gyro_Node15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'gyro_Sibling', the role 'gyro_Sibling14' has cardinality 0..*.
