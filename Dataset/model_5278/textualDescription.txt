The domain model 'sample' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'SampleClassInterface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sample_SampleClassC' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sample_SampleClassB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sample_SampleClassInterface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sample_SampleClassA' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'sampleAttribute', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Tristate' defines the following possible values: 'TRUE', 'FALSE', 'UNDEFINED'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sample_SampleClassA' is a specialization of 'SampleClassInterface'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sample_SampleClassA' and 'sample_SampleClassC'. From 'sample_SampleClassA', the role 'sample_SampleClassA' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sample_SampleClassC', the role 'sample_SampleClassC' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sample_SampleClassC' and 'sample_SampleClassB'. From 'sample_SampleClassC', the role 'sample_SampleClassC2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sample_SampleClassB', the role 'sample_SampleClassB' has cardinality 0..*.
