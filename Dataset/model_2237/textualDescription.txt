The domain model 'studies' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'studies_StudyYear' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'programName', which is of type str.

'studies_StudyCourse' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'mandatory', which is of type bool.

'studies_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str; 'studyPoints', which is of type float.

'studies_StudyInstance' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'year', which is of type int.

'studies_University' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'studies_Study' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'code', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'studies_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'studyYearSemester', which is of type str.

'studies_CourseInstance' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'instanceName', which is of type str; 'year', which is of type int; 'semester', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SemesterCode' defines the following possible values: 'Spring', 'Autumn'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'studies_Course' and 'studies_University'. From 'studies_Course', the role 'studies_Course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studies_University', the role 'studies_University' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studies_University' and 'studies_Study'. From 'studies_University', the role 'studies_University2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studies_Study', the role 'studies_Study' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'studies_CourseInstance' and 'studies_Course'. From 'studies_CourseInstance', the role 'CourseInstance' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'studies_Course', the role 'course' has cardinality 0..*.
