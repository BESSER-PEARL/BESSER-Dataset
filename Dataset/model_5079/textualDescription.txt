The domain model 'adlrecur' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'Component' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlrecur_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'adlrecur_Required' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlrecur_Provided' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlrecur_Base' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'adlrecur_Interface' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'signature', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'adlrecur_Binding' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'adlrecur_Required' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adlrecur_Provided' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adlrecur_Base' is a specialization of 'Component'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'adlrecur_Component' and 'adlrecur_Required'. From 'adlrecur_Component', the role 'adlrecur_Component' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlrecur_Required', the role 'adlrecur_Required' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlrecur_Provided' and 'adlrecur_Component'. From 'adlrecur_Provided', the role 'adlrecur_Provided' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlrecur_Component', the role 'adlrecur_Component2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlrecur_Binding' and 'adlrecur_Interface'. From 'adlrecur_Binding', the role 'adlrecur_Binding' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlrecur_Interface', the role 'adlrecur_Interface' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlrecur_Interface' and 'adlrecur_Binding'. From 'adlrecur_Interface', the role 'adlrecur_Interface6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlrecur_Binding', the role 'adlrecur_Binding5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlrecur_Interface' and 'adlrecur_Binding'. From 'adlrecur_Interface', the role 'adlrecur_Interface9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlrecur_Binding', the role 'adlrecur_Binding8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'adlrecur_Base' and 'adlrecur_Base'. From 'adlrecur_Base', the role 'adlrecur_Base10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'adlrecur_Base', the role 'adlrecur_Base' has cardinality 0..*.
