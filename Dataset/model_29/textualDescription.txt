The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tokensCount', which is of type int.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'tokensCount', which is of type int; 'readOnly', which is of type bool; 'kind', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Network' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ArcKind' defines the following possible values: 'read_arc', 'normal'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Network'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Network', the role 'reseau' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Arc' and 'petrinet_Network'. From 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'Arc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Network', the role 'reseau2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Network' and 'petrinet_Node'. From 'petrinet_Network', the role 'Network' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Node', the role 'nodes' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'target' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'Arc5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Arc' and 'petrinet_Node'. From 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'Arc7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Node', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Network' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Network', the role 'Network9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'arcs' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'Node11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'successors' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Arc' and 'petrinet_Node'. From 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'predecessors' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Node', the role 'Node13' has cardinality 0..*.
