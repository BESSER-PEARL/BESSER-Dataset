Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'DOUBLE', 'VOID', 'BIGINTEGER', 'VARCHAR', 'OID'.
The enumeration 'Operation' defines the following possible values: 'update', 'delete', 'readONE', '_create', 'readALL', 'forward', 'read'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'SMVC_EntityController' is a specialization of 'Controller'.
The class 'SMVC_EntityComponent' is a specialization of 'Component'.
The class 'SMVC_List' is a specialization of 'EntityComponent'.
The class 'SMVC_Form' is a specialization of 'EntityComponent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'SMVC_SMVCApplication' and 'SMVC_Controller'. From 'SMVC_SMVCApplication', the role 'SMVC_SMVCApplication' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SMVC_Controller', the role 'SMVC_Controller' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SMVC_SMVCApplication' and 'SMVC_Controller'. From 'SMVC_SMVCApplication', the role 'SMVC_SMVCApplication2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SMVC_Controller', the role 'SMVC_Controller3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SMVC_SMVCApplication' and 'SMVC_DataAccessObject'. From 'SMVC_SMVCApplication', the role 'SMVC_SMVCApplication5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SMVC_DataAccessObject', the role 'SMVC_DataAccessObject' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SMVC_Entity' and 'SMVC_SMVCApplication'. From 'SMVC_Entity', the role 'SMVC_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SMVC_SMVCApplication', the role 'SMVC_SMVCApplication7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'SMVC_Controller' and 'SMVC_Controller'. From 'SMVC_Controller', the role 'SMVC_Controller8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'SMVC_Controller', the role 'SMVC_Controller10' has cardinality 0..*.
