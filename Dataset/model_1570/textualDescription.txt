The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graph_Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'weigth', which is of type int; 'label', which is of type str.

'graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Vertex' and 'graph_Graph'. From 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph_Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph_Graph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Vertex' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Vertex' and 'graph_Edge'. From 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Edge', the role 'graph_Edge7' has cardinality 0..*.
