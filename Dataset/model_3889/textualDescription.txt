Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'workflow_StateTransition' and 'workflow_Workflow'. From 'workflow_StateTransition', the role 'workflow_StateTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_Workflow', the role 'workflow_Workflow' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_StateTransition' and 'workflow_FromState'. From 'workflow_StateTransition', the role 'StateTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_FromState', the role 'from' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_ToState' and 'workflow_StateTransition'. From 'workflow_ToState', the role 'to' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_StateTransition', the role 'StateTransition3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_Start' and 'workflow_StateContainer'. From 'workflow_Start', the role 'Start' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_StateContainer', the role 'stateContainer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_StateContainer' and 'workflow_IntermediateState'. From 'workflow_StateContainer', the role 'stateContainer6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_IntermediateState', the role 'IntermediateState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_End' and 'workflow_StateContainer'. From 'workflow_End', the role 'End' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_StateContainer', the role 'stateContainer8' has cardinality 0..*.
