An association connects 'DB_Table' and 'DB_Database'. From 'DB_Table', the role 'DB_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DB_Database', the role 'DB_Database' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'DB_Table' and 'DB_Column'. From 'DB_Table', the role 'DB_Table2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'DB_Column', the role 'DB_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
