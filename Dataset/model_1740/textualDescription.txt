Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SourceType' defines the following possible values: 'OTHER', 'CASSETTE', 'CD', 'HDD'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

The class 'MediaLibrary_Video' is a specialization of 'DurationArtifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Ebook' is a specialization of 'Artifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Image' is a specialization of 'Artifact'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_ExternalSource' is a specialization of 'MediaSource'.
The class 'MediaLibrary_Store' is a specialization of 'MediaSource'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
