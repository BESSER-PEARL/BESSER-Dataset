The domain model 'type' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 26 main class(es).

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Containment' defines the following possible values: 'Non', 'Target', 'Source'.
The enumeration 'RelationType' defines the following possible values: 'One2Many', 'One2One', 'Many2Many'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
