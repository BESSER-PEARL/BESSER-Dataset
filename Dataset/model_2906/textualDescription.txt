The domain model 'Data' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'Type' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Data_PrimitiveType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Data_Type' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Data_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Data_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Data_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Data_Entity' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'Data_PrimitiveType' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Data_Model' and 'Data_Type'. From 'Data_Model', the role 'Data_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Data_Type', the role 'Data_Type' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Data_Attribute' and 'Data_Type'. From 'Data_Attribute', the role 'Data_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Data_Type', the role 'Data_Type2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Data_Entity' and 'Data_Attribute'. From 'Data_Entity', the role 'Data_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Data_Attribute', the role 'Data_Attribute4' has cardinality 0..*.
