An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Entity' and 'entities_Feature'. From 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Feature', the role 'entities_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'entities_Feature' and 'entities_Entity'. From 'entities_Feature', the role 'entities_Feature7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'entities_Entity', the role 'entities_Entity8' has cardinality 0..*.
