An association connects 'addressbook_Country' and 'addressbook_AddressBook'. From 'addressbook_Country', the role 'addressbook_Country' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_AddressBook', the role 'addressbook_AddressBook' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_Address' and 'addressbook_Person'. From 'addressbook_Address', the role 'Address' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Person', the role 'person' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_AddressBook' and 'addressbook_Person'. From 'addressbook_AddressBook', the role 'AddressBook' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Person', the role 'persons' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'addressbook_Country' and 'addressbook_Address'. From 'addressbook_Country', the role 'addressbook_Country5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'addressbook_Address', the role 'addressbook_Address' has cardinality 0..*.
