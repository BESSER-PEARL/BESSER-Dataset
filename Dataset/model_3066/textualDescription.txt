Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ConditionType' defines the following possible values: 'Show', 'None', 'Hide', 'Enable', 'Disable'.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'Text', 'Boolean', 'Integer', 'Email', 'Year', 'Time', 'None', 'Date', 'String'.
The enumeration 'CompositeConditionType' defines the following possible values: 'And', 'Or'.
