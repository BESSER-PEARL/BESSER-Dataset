The model defines 4 main class(es).

'test1_ConceptA' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test1_ConceptB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'test1_ConceptC' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'test1_ConceptB' is a specialization of 'ConceptA'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'test1_ConceptC' and 'test1_ConceptA'. From 'test1_ConceptC', the role 'test1_ConceptC' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'test1_ConceptA', the role 'test1_ConceptA' has cardinality 0..*.
