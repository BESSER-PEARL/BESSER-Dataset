The domain model 'library' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'library_Writer' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'library_Library' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'site', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BookCategory' defines the following possible values: 'IT', 'ScienceFiction', 'Biography', 'Mystery'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'library_Writer' is a specialization of 'Person'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'library_Book' and 'library_Writer'. From 'library_Book', the role 'books' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Writer', the role 'Writer' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Writer' and 'library_Library'. From 'library_Writer', the role 'library_Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Book'. From 'library_Library', the role 'library_Library3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Book', the role 'library_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'library_Library' and 'library_Person'. From 'library_Library', the role 'Library' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'library_Person', the role 'hr.ecorePerson' has cardinality 0..*.
