The domain model 'uispecDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'uispecDsl_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'uispecDsl_EntityReference' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'uispecDsl_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'uispecDsl_TextFieldWidget' is a specialization of 'Widget'.
The class 'uispecDsl_CheckBoxWidget' is a specialization of 'Widget'.
The class 'uispecDsl_ComboWidget' is a specialization of 'Widget'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'uispecDsl_EntityReference' and 'uispecDsl_Form'. From 'uispecDsl_EntityReference', the role 'uispecDsl_EntityReference' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uispecDsl_Form', the role 'uispecDsl_Form' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uispecDsl_Field' and 'uispecDsl_Form'. From 'uispecDsl_Field', the role 'uispecDsl_Field' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uispecDsl_Form', the role 'uispecDsl_Form2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uispecDsl_Entity' and 'uispecDsl_EntityReference'. From 'uispecDsl_Entity', the role 'uispecDsl_Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uispecDsl_EntityReference', the role 'uispecDsl_EntityReference4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uispecDsl_Widget' and 'uispecDsl_Field'. From 'uispecDsl_Widget', the role 'uispecDsl_Widget' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uispecDsl_Field', the role 'uispecDsl_Field6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'uispecDsl_Attribute' and 'uispecDsl_Field'. From 'uispecDsl_Attribute', the role 'uispecDsl_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'uispecDsl_Field', the role 'uispecDsl_Field8' has cardinality 0..*.
