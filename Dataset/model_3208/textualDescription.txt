Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'llp_Task' and 'llp_LowLevelProgram'. From 'llp_Task', the role 'llp_Task' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'llp_LowLevelProgram', the role 'llp_LowLevelProgram' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'llp_LowLevelProgram' and 'llp_Block'. From 'llp_LowLevelProgram', the role 'llp_LowLevelProgram2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'llp_Block', the role 'llp_Block' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'llp_Task' and 'llp_Block'. From 'llp_Task', the role 'llp_Task4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'llp_Block', the role 'llp_Block5' has cardinality 0..*.
