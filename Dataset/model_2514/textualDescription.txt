Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MyEnum' defines the following possible values: 'ONE', 'THREE', 'TWO', 'ZERO'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model6_ReferenceObject' is a specialization of 'BaseObject'.
The class 'model6_ContainmentObject' is a specialization of 'BaseObject'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
