The domain model 'petrinet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'petrinet_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_PNGraph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petrinet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'markings', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'petrinet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'w', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petrinet_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petrinet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_Place' and 'petrinet_PNGraph'. From 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_PNGraph', the role 'petrinet_PNGraph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PNGraph' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_PNGraph', the role 'petrinet_PNGraph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PNGraph' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_PNGraph', the role 'petrinet_PNGraph4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'petrinet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Node' and 'petrinet_Arc'. From 'petrinet_Node', the role 'petrinet_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'petrinet_Arc6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_Arc' and 'petrinet_Node'. From 'petrinet_Arc', the role 'petrinet_Arc8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Node', the role 'petrinet_Node9' has cardinality 0..*.
