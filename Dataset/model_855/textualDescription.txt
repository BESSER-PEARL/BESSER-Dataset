The domain model 'fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'fsm_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'trigger', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str.

'fsm_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'consummedString', which is of type str; 'underProcessTrigger', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fsm_System' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsm_Buffer' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'currentValues', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'initialValue', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Transition' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_Transition', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_Buffer' and 'fsm_FSM'. From 'fsm_Buffer', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_FSM', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_Buffer'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_Buffer', the role '10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsm_FSM' and 'fsm_State'. From 'fsm_FSM', the role 'fsm_FSM13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsm_State', the role 'fsm_State14' has cardinality 0..*.
