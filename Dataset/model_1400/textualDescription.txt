The domain model 'fsmcore' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 19 main class(es).

'fsmcore_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fsmcore_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PseudostateKind' defines a single possible value: 'initial'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fsmcore_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsmcore_Region' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsmcore_AbstractState' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsmcore_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'fsmcore_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'fsmcore_Conditional' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'fsmcore_Loop' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'fsmcore_VarDecl' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'fsmcore_Pseudostate' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'fsmcore_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fsmcore_Region' and 'fsmcore_StateMachine'. From 'fsmcore_Region', the role 'fsmcore_Region' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsmcore_StateMachine', the role 'fsmcore_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsmcore_AbstractState' and 'fsmcore_Region'. From 'fsmcore_AbstractState', the role '2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsmcore_Region', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsmcore_Transition' and 'fsmcore_Region'. From 'fsmcore_Transition', the role 'fsmcore_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsmcore_Region', the role 'fsmcore_Region4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsmcore_Transition' and 'fsmcore_AbstractState'. From 'fsmcore_Transition', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsmcore_AbstractState', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fsmcore_AbstractState' and 'fsmcore_Transition'. From 'fsmcore_AbstractState', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fsmcore_Transition', the role '10' has cardinality 0..*.
