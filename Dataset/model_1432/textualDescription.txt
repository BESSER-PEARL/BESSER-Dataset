The domain model 'Graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'Graph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Graph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'size', which is of type float; 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Graph_Edge' and 'Graph_Node'. From 'Graph_Edge', the role 'Graph_Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph_Node', the role 'Graph_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Graph_Node' and 'Graph_Edge'. From 'Graph_Node', the role 'Graph_Node3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Graph_Edge', the role 'Graph_Edge2' has cardinality 0..*.
