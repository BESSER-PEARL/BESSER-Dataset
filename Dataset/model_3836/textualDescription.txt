The domain model 'database' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'database_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'database_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'database_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'database_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'is_local', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_Schema'. From 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Schema', the role 'database_Schema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Column' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_Column', the role 'database_Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_ForeignKey' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_ForeignKey', the role 'database_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Column' and 'database_Table'. From 'database_Column', the role 'database_Column7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_ForeignKey' and 'database_Column'. From 'database_ForeignKey', the role 'database_ForeignKey9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_Column', the role 'database_Column10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'database_Table' and 'database_ForeignKey'. From 'database_Table', the role 'database_Table13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'database_ForeignKey', the role 'database_ForeignKey12' has cardinality 0..*.
