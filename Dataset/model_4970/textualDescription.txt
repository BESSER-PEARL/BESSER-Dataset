The domain model 'yuml' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 18 main class(es).

'yuml_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'stereotype', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'yuml_ClassMember' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'visibility', which is of type str.

'yuml_NoteAssociation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yuml_ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yuml_Method' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'arguments', which is of type str.

'ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AssociationType' defines the following possible values: 'simpleAssociation', 'composition', 'aggregation'.
The enumeration 'Visibility' defines the following possible values: 'protected', 'private', 'unspecified', 'package', 'public'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'yuml_ColorableElement' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'yuml_Class' is a specialization of 'ColorableElement'.
The class 'yuml_Relationship' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'yuml_Association' is a specialization of 'Relationship'.
The class 'yuml_Inheritance' is a specialization of 'Relationship'.
The class 'yuml_Attribute' is a specialization of 'ClassMember'.
The class 'yuml_Method' is a specialization of 'ClassMember'.
The class 'yuml_Note' is a specialization of 'ColorableElement'.
The class 'yuml_NoteAssociation' is a specialization of 'Relationship'.
The class 'yuml_Equivalence' is a specialization of 'Relationship'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'yuml_Model' and 'yuml_ModelElement'. From 'yuml_Model', the role 'yuml_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_ModelElement', the role 'yuml_ModelElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Class' and 'yuml_Attribute'. From 'yuml_Class', the role 'yuml_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_Attribute', the role 'yuml_Attribute' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Class' and 'yuml_Method'. From 'yuml_Class', the role 'yuml_Class3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_Method', the role 'yuml_Method' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Relationship' and 'yuml_Class'. From 'yuml_Relationship', the role 'yuml_Relationship' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_Class', the role 'yuml_Class5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Relationship' and 'yuml_ColorableElement'. From 'yuml_Relationship', the role 'yuml_Relationship7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_ColorableElement', the role 'yuml_ColorableElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Cardinality' and 'yuml_Association'. From 'yuml_Cardinality', the role 'yuml_Cardinality' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_Association', the role 'yuml_Association' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Cardinality' and 'yuml_Association'. From 'yuml_Cardinality', the role 'yuml_Cardinality11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_Association', the role 'yuml_Association10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yuml_Note' and 'yuml_NoteAssociation'. From 'yuml_Note', the role 'yuml_Note' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yuml_NoteAssociation', the role 'yuml_NoteAssociation' has cardinality 0..*.
