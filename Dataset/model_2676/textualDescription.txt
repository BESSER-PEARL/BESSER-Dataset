The domain model 'kref' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'kref_J' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_Named' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'kref_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_K' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kref_H' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'kref_A' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_B' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_C' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_E' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_E' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'kref_F' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_G' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_H' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_J' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'kref_K' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'kref_A' and 'kref_B'. From 'kref_A', the role 'kref_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_B', the role 'kref_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_K' and 'kref_A'. From 'kref_K', the role 'kref_K' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_A', the role 'kref_A2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_B' and 'kref_C'. From 'kref_B', the role 'kref_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_C', the role 'kref_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_B' and 'kref_G'. From 'kref_B', the role 'kref_B6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_G', the role 'kref_G' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_E' and 'kref_F'. From 'kref_E', the role 'kref_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_F', the role 'kref_F' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_F' and 'kref_J'. From 'kref_F', the role 'kref_F9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_J', the role 'kref_J' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_K' and 'kref_F'. From 'kref_K', the role 'kref_K12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_F', the role 'kref_F11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kref_G' and 'kref_H'. From 'kref_G', the role 'kref_G14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kref_H', the role 'kref_H' has cardinality 0..*.
