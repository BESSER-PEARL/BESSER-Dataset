The domain model 'ER' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'ER_ERSchema' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ER_Relship' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ER_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ER_ERAttribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isKey', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'ER_RelshipEnd' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ER_Entity' and 'ER_ERSchema'. From 'ER_Entity', the role 'Entity' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_ERSchema', the role 'schema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_ERSchema' and 'ER_Relship'. From 'ER_ERSchema', the role 'schema2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_Relship', the role 'Relship' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_ERAttribute' and 'ER_Entity'. From 'ER_ERAttribute', the role 'ERAttribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_Entity', the role 'entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_Entity' and 'ER_RelshipEnd'. From 'ER_Entity', the role 'entity5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_RelshipEnd', the role 'RelshipEnd' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_Entity' and 'ER_ERSchema'. From 'ER_Entity', the role 'entities' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_ERSchema', the role 'ERSchema' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_ERAttribute' and 'ER_Relship'. From 'ER_ERAttribute', the role 'ERAttribute8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_Relship', the role 'relship' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_Relship' and 'ER_RelshipEnd'. From 'ER_Relship', the role 'relship10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_RelshipEnd', the role 'RelshipEnd11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ER_Relship' and 'ER_ERSchema'. From 'ER_Relship', the role 'relships' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ER_ERSchema', the role 'ERSchema13' has cardinality 0..*.
