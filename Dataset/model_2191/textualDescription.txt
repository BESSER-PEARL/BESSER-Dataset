The domain model 'sample' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 18 main class(es).

'sample_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SomeKind' defines the following possible values: 'one', 'Three', 'Two'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sample_PhysicalNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'sample_RemoteNode' is a specialization of 'PhysicalNode'.
The class 'sample_LocalNode' is a specialization of 'PhysicalNode'.
The class 'sample_VirtualNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
