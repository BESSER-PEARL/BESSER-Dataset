The domain model 'model' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'model_FSM' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'model_Buffer' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'initialValue', which is of type str.

'model_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'model_System' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'trigger', which is of type str; 'action', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'model_FSM' and 'model_State'. From 'model_FSM', the role 'fsm' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_FSM' and 'model_Transition'. From 'model_FSM', the role 'fsm2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'model_Buffer' and 'model_FSM'. From 'model_Buffer', the role 'Buffer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'model_FSM', the role 'outgoingFSM' has cardinality 0..*.
