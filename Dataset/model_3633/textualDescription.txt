Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PseudostateKind' defines the following possible values: 'entryPoint', 'choice', 'deepHistory', 'terminate', 'join', 'exitPoint', 'initial', 'junction', 'fork', 'shallowHistory'.
The enumeration 'TransitionKind' defines the following possible values: 'internal', 'external', 'local'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'umlstatemachineselect_StateMachine' is a specialization of 'Behavior'.
