The domain model 'NHSM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'NHSM_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'NHSM_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NHSM_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'NHSM_StateMachine' and 'NHSM_State'. From 'NHSM_StateMachine', the role 'machine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'NHSM_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'NHSM_Transition' and 'NHSM_StateMachine'. From 'NHSM_Transition', the role 'NHSM_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'NHSM_StateMachine', the role 'NHSM_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'NHSM_StateMachine' and 'NHSM_State'. From 'NHSM_StateMachine', the role 'StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'NHSM_State', the role 'states' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'NHSM_State' and 'NHSM_Transition'. From 'NHSM_State', the role 'NHSM_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'NHSM_Transition', the role 'NHSM_Transition4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'NHSM_State' and 'NHSM_Transition'. From 'NHSM_State', the role 'NHSM_State7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'NHSM_Transition', the role 'NHSM_Transition6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'NHSM_StateMachine' and 'NHSM_Transition'. From 'NHSM_StateMachine', the role 'NHSM_StateMachine10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'NHSM_Transition', the role 'NHSM_Transition9' has cardinality 0..*.
