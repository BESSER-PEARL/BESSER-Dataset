The domain model 'e' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'e_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'e_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'e_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'e_E' and 'e_D'. From 'e_E', the role 'e_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_D', the role 'e_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'e_F' and 'e_E'. From 'e_F', the role 'e_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'e_E', the role 'e_E2' has cardinality 0..*.
