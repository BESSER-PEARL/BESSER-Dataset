The domain model 'cycle' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'cycle_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'cycle_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'i', which is of type int; 'j', which is of type int.

'cycle_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'x', which is of type float; 'y', which is of type float.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'cycle_B' and 'cycle_A'. From 'cycle_B', the role 'cycle_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cycle_A', the role 'cycle_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cycle_B' and 'cycle_A'. From 'cycle_B', the role 'cycle_B2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cycle_A', the role 'cycle_A3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cycle_B' and 'cycle_C'. From 'cycle_B', the role 'cycle_B5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cycle_C', the role 'cycle_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'cycle_A' and 'cycle_C'. From 'cycle_A', the role 'cycle_A8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'cycle_C', the role 'cycle_C7' has cardinality 0..*.
