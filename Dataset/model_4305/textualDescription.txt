The domain model 'metrics' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'metrics_MetricSource' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'metrickind', which is of type str; 'location', which is of type str; 'lastPurge', which is of type str; 'lastContact', which is of type str.

'metrics_Value' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'metrics_Value' and 'metrics_MetricSource'. From 'metrics_Value', the role 'metrics_Value' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'metrics_MetricSource', the role 'metrics_MetricSource' has cardinality 0..*.
