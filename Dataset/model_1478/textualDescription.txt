The domain model 'graphmodelling' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'graphmodelling_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphmodelling_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphmodelling_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphmodelling_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'height', which is of type str; 'category', which is of type str; 'text', which is of type str; 'y', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'accessModifier', which is of type str; 'ID', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type str; 'className', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'group', which is of type str; 'width', which is of type str; 'x', which is of type str.

'graphmodelling_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'graphmodelling_ModellingType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'graphmodelling_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'graphmodelling_Graph' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'graphmodelling_Node' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'graphmodelling_Property' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'graphmodelling_Operation' is a specialization of 'Entity'.
The class 'graphmodelling_Edge' is a specialization of 'Entity'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Graph' and 'graphmodelling_Node'. From 'graphmodelling_Graph', the role 'graphmodelling_Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Graph' and 'graphmodelling_Edge'. From 'graphmodelling_Graph', the role 'graphmodelling_Graph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Edge', the role 'graphmodelling_Edge' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Node' and 'graphmodelling_Node'. From 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Node' and 'graphmodelling_Node'. From 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Node' and 'graphmodelling_Property'. From 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Property', the role 'graphmodelling_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Operation' and 'graphmodelling_Node'. From 'graphmodelling_Operation', the role 'graphmodelling_Operation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Node' and 'graphmodelling_Edge'. From 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Edge', the role 'graphmodelling_Edge14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graphmodelling_Node' and 'graphmodelling_Edge'. From 'graphmodelling_Node', the role 'graphmodelling_Node18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graphmodelling_Edge', the role 'graphmodelling_Edge17' has cardinality 0..*.
