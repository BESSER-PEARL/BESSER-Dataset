The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'adl402_Required' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adl402_Provided' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'adl402_EClass1' is a specialization of 'Binding'.
The class 'adl402_EClass2' is a specialization of 'Binding'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
