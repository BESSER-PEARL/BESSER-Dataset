Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'GoToStrategy' defines the following possible values: 'VERTICAL_FIRST', 'DIRECT', 'HORIZONTAL_FIRST'.
The enumeration 'TravelMode' defines the following possible values: 'NORMAL', 'AGGRESSIVE', 'SAFE'.
