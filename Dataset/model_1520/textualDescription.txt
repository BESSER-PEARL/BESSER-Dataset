The model defines 3 main class(es).

'sm6_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'isFinal', which is of type str.

'sm6_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'event', which is of type str.

'sm6_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
