The domain model 'dsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'dsl_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'dsl_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dsl_Command' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'dsl_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'dsl_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'dsl_Statemachine' and 'dsl_Event'. From 'dsl_Statemachine', the role 'dsl_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_Event', the role 'dsl_Event' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_Statemachine' and 'dsl_Event'. From 'dsl_Statemachine', the role 'dsl_Statemachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_Event', the role 'dsl_Event3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_Statemachine' and 'dsl_State'. From 'dsl_Statemachine', the role 'dsl_Statemachine5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_Command' and 'dsl_Statemachine'. From 'dsl_Command', the role 'dsl_Command' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_Statemachine', the role 'dsl_Statemachine7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_Statemachine' and 'dsl_State'. From 'dsl_Statemachine', the role 'dsl_Statemachine9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_State' and 'dsl_Command'. From 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_Command', the role 'dsl_Command13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_Transition' and 'dsl_State'. From 'dsl_Transition', the role 'dsl_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_State' and 'dsl_State'. From 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_Event' and 'dsl_Transition'. From 'dsl_Event', the role 'dsl_Event21' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_Transition', the role 'dsl_Transition20' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'dsl_State' and 'dsl_Transition'. From 'dsl_State', the role 'dsl_State24' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'dsl_Transition', the role 'dsl_Transition23' has cardinality 0..*.
