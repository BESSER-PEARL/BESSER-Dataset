The class 'tfsm_State' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'tfsm_Transition' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'tfsm_Guard' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'tfsm_TemporalGuard' is a specialization of 'Guard'.
The class 'tfsm_EventGuard' is a specialization of 'Guard'.
The class 'tfsm_FSMEvent' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'tfsm_FSMClock' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
