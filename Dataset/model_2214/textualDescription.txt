Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Grade' defines the following possible values: 'D', 'C', 'A', 'F', 'E', 'B'.
The enumeration 'Season' defines the following possible values: 'spring', 'fall'.
The enumeration 'CourseStatus' defines the following possible values: 'mandatory', 'elective'.
