The domain model 'nodesAndEdges' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'nodesAndEdges_Node_toString' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nodesAndEdges_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'nodesAndEdges_ColoredNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'color', which is of type str.

'nodesAndEdges_ShapedNode' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'shape', which is of type str; 'size', which is of type float.

'nodesAndEdges_ShapedNode_toString' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nodesAndEdges_Edge_toString' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nodesAndEdges_ColoredNode_toString' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'nodesAndEdges_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Color' defines the following possible values: 'blue', 'red'.
The enumeration 'EdgeViewType' defines the following possible values: 'solidline', 'dashline'.
The enumeration 'Shape' defines the following possible values: 'square', 'round'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'nodesAndEdges_ColoredNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'nodesAndEdges_ShapedNode' is a specialization of 'Node'.
