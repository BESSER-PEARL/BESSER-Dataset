The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'muddle_MuddleElementType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'muddle_LinkElementType' is a specialization of 'MuddleElementType'.
The class 'muddle_PrimitiveType' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'muddle_IntegerType' is a specialization of 'PrimitiveType'.
The class 'muddle_StringType' is a specialization of 'PrimitiveType'.
The class 'muddle_BooleanType' is a specialization of 'PrimitiveType'.
The class 'muddle_RealType' is a specialization of 'PrimitiveType'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
