Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'RulerUnit' defines the following possible values: 'INCHES', 'CENTIMETERS', 'PIXELS'.
The enumeration 'LineStyle' defines the following possible values: 'DASHDOT', 'DASHDOTDOT', 'DOT', 'SOLID', 'LINE_CUSTOM', 'DASH'.
The enumeration 'Alignment' defines the following possible values: 'RIGHT', 'TOP', 'BOTTOM', 'CENTER', 'LEFT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'di_Node' is a specialization of 'View'.
The class 'di_Container' is a specialization of 'View'.
The class 'di_Diagram' is a specialization of 'Container'.
The class 'di_Shape' is a specialization of 'Container'.
The class 'di_Shape' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'di_GradientShape' is a specialization of 'Shape'.
The class 'di_Line' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'di_Connector' is a specialization of 'Line'.
The class 'di_Comment' is a specialization of 'Shape'.
The class 'di_CommentLink' is a specialization of 'Line'.
