The domain model 'classdiagram' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'classdiagram_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_TypedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'public', which is of type bool.

'classdiagram_Dependency' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'classdiagram_ClassDiagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_Association' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'classdiagram_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'classdiagram_Class' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Attribute' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Operation' is a specialization of 'TypedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_TypedElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'classdiagram_Association' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
