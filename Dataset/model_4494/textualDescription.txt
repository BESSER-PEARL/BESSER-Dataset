Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'LED_Color' defines the following possible values: 'LED_ORANGE', 'LED_OFF', 'LED_RED', 'LED_GREEN'.
The enumeration 'Color' defines the following possible values: 'COLOR_RED', 'COLOR_BLUE', 'COLOR_GREEN', 'COLOR_ORANGE', 'COLOR_BLACK', 'COLOR_OFF', 'COLOR_WHITE'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'marsRover_Robot' and 'marsRover_mission'. From 'marsRover_Robot', the role 'marsRover_Robot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_mission', the role 'marsRover_mission' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'marsRover_mission' and 'marsRover_EObject'. From 'marsRover_mission', the role 'marsRover_mission2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_EObject', the role 'marsRover_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'marsRover_avoid_obstacles' and 'marsRover_EObject'. From 'marsRover_avoid_obstacles', the role 'marsRover_avoid_obstacles' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_EObject', the role 'marsRover_EObject4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'marsRover_detect_lakes' and 'marsRover_after_action'. From 'marsRover_detect_lakes', the role 'marsRover_detect_lakes' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_after_action', the role 'marsRover_after_action' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'marsRover_detect_rocks' and 'marsRover_after_action'. From 'marsRover_detect_rocks', the role 'marsRover_detect_rocks' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_after_action', the role 'marsRover_after_action7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'marsRover_indication' and 'marsRover_after_action'. From 'marsRover_indication', the role 'marsRover_indication' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_after_action', the role 'marsRover_after_action9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'marsRover_EObject' and 'marsRover_indication'. From 'marsRover_EObject', the role 'marsRover_EObject12' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'marsRover_indication', the role 'marsRover_indication11' has cardinality 0..*.
