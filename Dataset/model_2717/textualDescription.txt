The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'k4_A' is a specialization of 'B'.
The class 'k4_B' is a specialization of 'C'.
The class 'k4_C' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'k4_M' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'k4_N' is a specialization of 'M'.
The class 'k4_J' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'k4_P' is a specialization of 'N'.
The class 'k4_Q' is a specialization of 'P'.
The class 'k4_I' is a specialization of 'G'.
The class 'k4_K' is a specialization of 'J'.
The class 'k4_L3' is a specialization of 'L1'.
The class 'k4_L4' is a specialization of 'L1'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
