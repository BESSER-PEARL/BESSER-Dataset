The domain model 'HSM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'HSM_HSM_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'label', which is of type str.

'HSM_HSM_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'HSM_HSM_CompositeState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_HSM_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_HSM_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'HSM_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_HSM_RegularState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'HSM_HSM_InitialState' is a specialization of 'HSM_AbstractState'.
The class 'HSM_HSM_RegularState' is a specialization of 'HSM_AbstractState'.
The class 'HSM_HSM_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'HSM_AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'HSM_HSM_Transition' and 'HSM_HSM_StateMachine'. From 'HSM_HSM_Transition', the role 'HSM_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_HSM_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_HSM_AbstractState' and 'HSM_HSM_StateMachine'. From 'HSM_HSM_AbstractState', the role 'HSM_AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_HSM_StateMachine', the role 'stateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_HSM_Transition' and 'HSM_HSM_StateMachine'. From 'HSM_HSM_Transition', the role 'transitions' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_HSM_StateMachine', the role 'HSM_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
