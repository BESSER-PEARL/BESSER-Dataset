The domain model 'MocaTree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'MocaTree_Folder' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MocaTree_Link' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MocaTree_TreeElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'index', which is of type int.

'MocaTree_File' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MocaTree_Text' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MocaTree_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'startLineIndex', which is of type int; 'stopLineIndex', which is of type int; 'stopIndex', which is of type int; 'startIndex', which is of type int.

'Text' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'MocaTree_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'TreeElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'MocaTree_Attribute' is a specialization of 'TreeElement'.
The class 'MocaTree_File' is a specialization of 'TreeElement'.
The class 'MocaTree_Folder' is a specialization of 'TreeElement'.
The class 'MocaTree_Link' is a specialization of 'TreeElement'.
The class 'MocaTree_Node' is a specialization of 'Text'.
The class 'MocaTree_Text' is a specialization of 'TreeElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'MocaTree_Attribute' and 'MocaTree_Node'. From 'MocaTree_Attribute', the role 'attribute' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MocaTree_Node', the role 'Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MocaTree_File' and 'MocaTree_Folder'. From 'MocaTree_File', the role 'file' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MocaTree_Folder', the role 'Folder' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'MocaTree_Node' and 'MocaTree_File'. From 'MocaTree_Node', the role 'Node4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'MocaTree_File', the role 'file3' has cardinality 0..*.
