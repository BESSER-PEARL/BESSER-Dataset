The domain model 'b' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'ASub' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'b_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ASub' and 'b_B'. From 'ASub', the role 'ASub' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'b_B', the role 'b_B' has cardinality 0..*.
