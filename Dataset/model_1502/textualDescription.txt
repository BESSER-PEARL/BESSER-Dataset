The domain model 'petri' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_TPArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_PetriNet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'petri_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'tokens', which is of type int.

'petri_PTArc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'petri_Place' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petri_Transition' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'petri_TPArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'petri_PTArc' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petri_Node' and 'petri_PetriNet'. From 'petri_Node', the role 'petri_Node' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_PetriNet', the role 'petri_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_PetriNet' and 'petri_Arc'. From 'petri_PetriNet', the role 'petri_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_Arc', the role 'petri_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_Transition' and 'petri_TPArc'. From 'petri_Transition', the role 'petri_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_TPArc', the role 'petri_TPArc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_Place' and 'petri_TPArc'. From 'petri_Place', the role 'petri_Place' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_TPArc', the role 'petri_TPArc5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_PTArc' and 'petri_Place'. From 'petri_PTArc', the role 'petri_PTArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_Place', the role 'petri_Place7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petri_Transition' and 'petri_PTArc'. From 'petri_Transition', the role 'petri_Transition10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petri_PTArc', the role 'petri_PTArc9' has cardinality 0..*.
