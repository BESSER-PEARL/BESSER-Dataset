The domain model 'reference' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'reference_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_H' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_Named' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_F' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'reference_G' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'reference_A' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'reference_B' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'reference_C' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'reference_E' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'reference_F' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'reference_G' is a specialization of 'Named'.
The class 'reference_H' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'reference_A' and 'reference_B'. From 'reference_A', the role 'reference_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_B', the role 'reference_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_A' and 'reference_E'. From 'reference_A', the role 'reference_A2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_E', the role 'reference_E' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_A' and 'reference_C'. From 'reference_A', the role 'reference_A4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_C', the role 'reference_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_G' and 'reference_A'. From 'reference_G', the role 'reference_G' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_A', the role 'reference_A6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_A' and 'reference_H'. From 'reference_A', the role 'reference_A8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_H', the role 'reference_H' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_C' and 'reference_B'. From 'reference_C', the role 'reference_C11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_B', the role 'reference_B10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_B' and 'reference_G'. From 'reference_B', the role 'reference_B13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_G', the role 'reference_G14' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_F' and 'reference_E'. From 'reference_F', the role 'reference_F' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_E', the role 'reference_E16' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'reference_H' and 'reference_G'. From 'reference_H', the role 'reference_H19' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'reference_G', the role 'reference_G18' has cardinality 0..*.
