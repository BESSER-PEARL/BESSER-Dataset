The domain model 'A' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'A_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'A_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'A_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'A_E' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'A_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'A_B' and 'A_A'. From 'A_B', the role 'A_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_A', the role 'A_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'A_C' and 'A_B'. From 'A_C', the role 'A_C' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_B', the role 'A_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'A_B' and 'A_D'. From 'A_B', the role 'A_B4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_D', the role 'A_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'A_B' and 'A_B'. From 'A_B', the role 'A_B5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_B', the role 'A_B7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'A_E' and 'A_C'. From 'A_E', the role 'A_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'A_C', the role 'A_C9' has cardinality 0..*.
