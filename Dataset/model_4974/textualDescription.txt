The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ComponentLanguageDeep_InPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'ComponentLanguageDeep_OutPort' is a specialization of 'Port'.
The class 'ComponentLanguageDeep_InPortInstance' is a specialization of 'PortInstance'.
The class 'ComponentLanguageDeep_OutPortInstance' is a specialization of 'PortInstance'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
