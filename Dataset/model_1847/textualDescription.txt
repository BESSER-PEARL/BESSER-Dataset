An association connects 'timetrack_Project' and 'timetrack_TimeEntry'. From 'timetrack_Project', the role 'timetrack_Project' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'timetrack_TimeEntry', the role 'timetrack_TimeEntry2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'timetrack_User' and 'timetrack_Library'. From 'timetrack_User', the role 'timetrack_User4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'timetrack_Library', the role 'timetrack_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'timetrack_Library' and 'timetrack_TimeEntry'. From 'timetrack_Library', the role 'timetrack_Library6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'timetrack_TimeEntry', the role 'timetrack_TimeEntry7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'timetrack_Project' and 'timetrack_Library'. From 'timetrack_Project', the role 'timetrack_Project10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'timetrack_Library', the role 'timetrack_Library9' has cardinality 0..*.
