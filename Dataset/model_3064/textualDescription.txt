Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Operators' defines the following possible values: 'AND', 'OR'.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'Email', 'Date', 'String', 'Boolean', 'Text', 'Time', 'Year', 'Integer', 'None'.
The enumeration 'ConditionType' defines the following possible values: 'Show', 'Disable', 'Enable', 'Hide'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'forms_AttributePageElement' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'forms_RelationshipPageElement' is a specialization of 'PageElement'.
The class 'forms_TextField' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_TextArea' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_SelectionField' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_DateSelectionField' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_TimeSelectionField' is a specialization of 'AttributePageElement'.
The class 'forms_List' is a specialization of 'RelationshipPageElement'.
The class 'forms_Table' is a specialization of 'RelationshipPageElement'.
The class 'forms_AttributeValueCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'forms_CompositeCondition' is a specialization of 'Condition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
