The domain model 'compositestates' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'compositestates_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'compositestates_Pseudostate' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'kind', which is of type str.

'compositestates_State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'compositestates_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'compositestates_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'compositestates_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PseudostateKind' defines a single possible value: 'initial'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'compositestates_Region' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'compositestates_State' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.
The class 'compositestates_Pseudostate' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'compositestates_Region' and 'compositestates_AbstractState'. From 'compositestates_Region', the role 'unnamed role' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'compositestates_AbstractState', the role '1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'compositestates_Region' and 'compositestates_State'. From 'compositestates_Region', the role '3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'compositestates_State', the role '4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'compositestates_State' and 'compositestates_Region'. From 'compositestates_State', the role '6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'compositestates_Region', the role '7' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'compositestates_AbstractState' and 'compositestates_Transition'. From 'compositestates_AbstractState', the role '9' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'compositestates_Transition', the role '10' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'compositestates_Transition' and 'compositestates_AbstractState'. From 'compositestates_Transition', the role '13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'compositestates_AbstractState', the role '12' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'compositestates_AbstractState' and 'compositestates_Region'. From 'compositestates_AbstractState', the role '15' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'compositestates_Region', the role '16' has cardinality 0..*.
