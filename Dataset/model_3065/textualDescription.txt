Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AttributeType' defines the following possible values: 'Boolean', 'Year', 'String', 'Text', 'Integer', 'Time', 'None', 'Email', 'Date'.
The enumeration 'ConditionType' defines the following possible values: 'Enable', 'Hide', 'None', 'Disable', 'Show'.
The enumeration 'CompositeConditionType' defines the following possible values: 'And', 'Or'.
