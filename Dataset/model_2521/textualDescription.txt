The domain model 'codemodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 16 main class(es).

'codemodel_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'codemodel_CodeModel' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_Variable' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_D' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_E' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_Root' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_expressions_Expression' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_expressions_VarExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'codemodel_expressions_BinExp' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'codemodel_statements_Statement' is a specialization of 'CMElement'.
The class 'codemodel_statements_AsgnStmt' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'codemodel_statements_CompStmt' is a specialization of 'Statement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'codemodel_CodeModel' and 'codemodel_Variable'. From 'codemodel_CodeModel', the role 'codemodel_CodeModel' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'codemodel_Variable', the role 'codemodel_Variable' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Statement' and 'codemodel_CodeModel'. From 'Statement', the role 'Statement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'codemodel_CodeModel', the role 'codemodel_CodeModel2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'codemodel_E' and 'codemodel_D'. From 'codemodel_E', the role 'codemodel_E' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'codemodel_D', the role 'codemodel_D' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'codemodel_CMElement' and 'codemodel_Root'. From 'codemodel_CMElement', the role 'codemodel_CMElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'codemodel_Root', the role 'codemodel_Root' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'codemodel_expressions_VarExp' and 'expressions_codemodel_Variable'. From 'codemodel_expressions_VarExp', the role 'codemodel_expressions_VarExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'expressions_codemodel_Variable', the role 'expressions_codemodel_Variable' has cardinality 0..*.
