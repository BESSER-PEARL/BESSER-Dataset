Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'TaskStatus' defines the following possible values: 'FINISHED', 'PREPARED', 'PROCESSING', 'NOT_PREPARED'.
The enumeration 'Language' defines the following possible values: 'Python', 'Java'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'workflow_AbstractTask' and 'workflow_TaskInput'. From 'workflow_AbstractTask', the role 'workflow_AbstractTask' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_TaskInput', the role 'workflow_TaskInput' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_TaskOutput' and 'workflow_AbstractTask'. From 'workflow_TaskOutput', the role 'workflow_TaskOutput' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_AbstractTask', the role 'workflow_AbstractTask2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'workflow_AbstractTask' and 'workflow_BaseTask'. From 'workflow_AbstractTask', the role 'workflow_AbstractTask4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'workflow_BaseTask', the role 'workflow_BaseTask' has cardinality 0..*.
