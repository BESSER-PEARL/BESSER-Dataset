The domain model 'HSM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'HSM_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'trigger', which is of type str; 'effect', which is of type str.

'HSM_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_InitialState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_CompositeState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'HSM_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'HSM_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'HSM_InitialState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'HSM_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'HSM_CompositeState' and 'HSM_State'. From 'HSM_CompositeState', the role 'HSM_CompositeState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_State', the role 'HSM_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_StateMachine' and 'HSM_State'. From 'HSM_StateMachine', the role 'StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_State', the role 'ownedState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_Transition' and 'HSM_State'. From 'HSM_Transition', the role 'HSM_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_State', the role 'HSM_State3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_Transition' and 'HSM_State'. From 'HSM_Transition', the role 'HSM_Transition5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_State', the role 'HSM_State6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_Transition' and 'HSM_StateMachine'. From 'HSM_Transition', the role 'ownedTransition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_StateMachine', the role 'StateMachine8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_Transition' and 'HSM_CompositeState'. From 'HSM_Transition', the role 'HSM_Transition10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_CompositeState', the role 'HSM_CompositeState11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_State' and 'HSM_CompositeState'. From 'HSM_State', the role 'HSM_State14' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_CompositeState', the role 'HSM_CompositeState13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'HSM_CompositeState' and 'HSM_Transition'. From 'HSM_CompositeState', the role 'HSM_CompositeState16' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'HSM_Transition', the role 'HSM_Transition17' has cardinality 0..*.
