The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fragdial_Required' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'fragdial_Provided' is a specialization of 'Interface'.
The class 'fragdial_Component' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.
The class 'fragdial_Component1' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.
The class 'fragdial_Component2' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.
The class 'fragdial_Component3' is a specialization of 'AbstractComponent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
