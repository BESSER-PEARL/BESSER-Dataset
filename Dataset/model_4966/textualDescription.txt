'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'KM3_LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'location', which is of type str.

'KM3_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'LocatedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'KM3_Enumeration' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'KM3_StructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isUnique', which is of type bool; 'lower', which is of type int; 'isOrdered', which is of type bool; 'upper', which is of type int.

'StructuralFeature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'KM3_Metamodel' represents an important domain concept.

'KM3_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'KM3_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'KM3_Reference' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'isContainer', which is of type bool.

'KM3_ModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'KM3_ModelElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'KM3_Classifier' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'KM3_DataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'KM3_Enumeration' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'KM3_EnumLiteral' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'KM3_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'KM3_StructuralFeature' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'KM3_Attribute' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.
The class 'KM3_Reference' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.
The class 'KM3_Package' is a specialization of 'ModelElement'.
The class 'KM3_Metamodel' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'KM3_Enumeration' and 'KM3_EnumLiteral'. From 'KM3_Enumeration', the role 'KM3_Enumeration' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'KM3_EnumLiteral', the role 'KM3_EnumLiteral' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'KM3_Class' and 'KM3_Class'. From 'KM3_Class', the role 'KM3_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'KM3_Class', the role 'KM3_Class1' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'KM3_Class' and 'KM3_StructuralFeature'. From 'KM3_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'KM3_StructuralFeature', the role 'StructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'KM3_Class' and 'KM3_StructuralFeature'. From 'KM3_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'KM3_StructuralFeature', the role 'structuralFeatures' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'KM3_Classifier' and 'KM3_StructuralFeature'. From 'KM3_Classifier', the role 'KM3_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'KM3_StructuralFeature', the role 'KM3_StructuralFeature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'KM3_Reference' and 'KM3_Reference'. From 'KM3_Reference', the role 'KM3_Reference6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'KM3_Reference', the role 'KM3_Reference' has cardinality 0..*.
