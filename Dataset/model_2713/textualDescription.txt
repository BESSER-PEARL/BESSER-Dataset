The domain model 'x' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'x_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'x_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'x_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'x_A' and 'x_C'. From 'x_A', the role 'x_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'x_C', the role 'x_C' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'x_C' and 'x_B'. From 'x_C', the role 'x_C2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'x_B', the role 'x_B' has cardinality 0..*.
