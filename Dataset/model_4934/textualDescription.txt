The domain model 'backbone' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'backbone_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'defaultValue', which is of type str; 'cardinality', which is of type str.

'backbone_RouterMapping' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'path', which is of type str.

'backbone_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_View' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_Router' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_Collection' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_Application' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'backbone_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'backbone_Reference' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'cardinality', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'CardinalityKind' defines the following possible values: 'ONE', 'MANY'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'backbone_Application' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Model' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Attribute' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Reference' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Operation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Parameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Collection' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_Router' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'backbone_View' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'backbone_Model' and 'backbone_Application'. From 'backbone_Model', the role 'Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'backbone_Application', the role 'application' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'backbone_Collection' and 'backbone_Application'. From 'backbone_Collection', the role 'Collection' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'backbone_Application', the role 'application2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'backbone_Application' and 'backbone_Router'. From 'backbone_Application', the role 'application4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'backbone_Router', the role 'Router' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'backbone_Application' and 'backbone_View'. From 'backbone_Application', the role 'application6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'backbone_View', the role 'View' has cardinality 0..*.
