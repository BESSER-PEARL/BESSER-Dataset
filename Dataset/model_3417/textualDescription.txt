Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tracker_Tag' and 'tracker_Animal'. From 'tracker_Tag', the role 'tracker_Tag' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Animal', the role 'tracker_Animal' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_Tag' and 'tracker_Event'. From 'tracker_Tag', the role 'tag' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Event', the role 'Event' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_Tag' and 'tracker_Event'. From 'tracker_Tag', the role 'Tag' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Event', the role 'events' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_Premises' and 'tracker_Animal'. From 'tracker_Premises', the role 'tracker_Premises' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Animal', the role 'tracker_Animal4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tracker_Premises' and 'tracker_Tag'. From 'tracker_Premises', the role 'tracker_Premises6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tracker_Tag', the role 'tracker_Tag7' has cardinality 0..*.
