The domain model 'boolexp' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 12 main class(es).

'boolexp_BinExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Lit' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'boolexp_Fals' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'boolexp_Tru' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'boolexp_BinExp' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'boolexp_Lit' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'boolexp_Tru' is a specialization of 'Lit'.
The class 'boolexp_Fals' is a specialization of 'Lit'.
The class 'boolexp_Not' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'boolexp_And' is a specialization of 'BinExp'.
The class 'boolexp_Or' is a specialization of 'BinExp'.
The class 'boolexp_VarRef' is a specialization of 'Exp'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'boolexp_BinExp' and 'boolexp_Exp'. From 'boolexp_BinExp', the role 'boolexp_BinExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'boolexp_Exp', the role 'boolexp_Exp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'boolexp_BinExp' and 'boolexp_Exp'. From 'boolexp_BinExp', the role 'boolexp_BinExp2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'boolexp_Exp', the role 'boolexp_Exp3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'boolexp_Exp' and 'boolexp_Not'. From 'boolexp_Exp', the role 'boolexp_Exp5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'boolexp_Not', the role 'boolexp_Not' has cardinality 0..*.
