The domain model 'services' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 19 main class(es).

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ServiceClassType' defines the following possible values: 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'services_CFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.
The class 'services_RFSService' is a specialization of 'Service'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
