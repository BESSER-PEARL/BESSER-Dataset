The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'LocatedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PetriNet' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Element' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Arc' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'PetriNet_PlaceToTransition' is a specialization of 'Arc'.
The class 'PetriNet_TransitionToPlace' is a specialization of 'Arc'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
