The domain model 'fl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'fl_EqualExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Argument' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'fl_Exp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_LiteralExp' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'fl_PlusExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_IfThenElseExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Exp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_ApplyExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_ArgumentExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_BinaryExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'BinaryExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_MinusExp' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fl_Function' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fl_LiteralExp' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'fl_ArgumentExp' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'fl_IfThenElseExp' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'fl_ApplyExp' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'fl_BinaryExp' is a specialization of 'Exp'.
The class 'fl_PlusExp' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'fl_MinusExp' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.
The class 'fl_EqualExp' is a specialization of 'BinaryExp'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fl_Function' and 'fl_Program'. From 'fl_Function', the role 'fl_Function' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Program', the role 'fl_Program' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Argument' and 'fl_Function'. From 'fl_Argument', the role 'fl_Argument' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Function', the role 'fl_Function2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Exp' and 'fl_Function'. From 'fl_Exp', the role 'fl_Exp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Function', the role 'fl_Function4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_ArgumentExp' and 'fl_Argument'. From 'fl_ArgumentExp', the role 'fl_ArgumentExp' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Argument', the role 'fl_Argument6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_Exp' and 'fl_IfThenElseExp'. From 'fl_Exp', the role 'fl_Exp8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_IfThenElseExp', the role 'fl_IfThenElseExp' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fl_IfThenElseExp' and 'fl_Exp'. From 'fl_IfThenElseExp', the role 'fl_IfThenElseExp10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fl_Exp', the role 'fl_Exp11' has cardinality 0..*.
