The domain model 'fmp' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'fmp_Constraint' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'text', which is of type str.

'fmp_Clonable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'state', which is of type str.

'Clonable' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fmp_FeatureGroup' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fmp_TypedValue' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'stringValue', which is of type str; 'integerValue', which is of type str; 'floatValue', which is of type str.

'fmp_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'valueType', which is of type str.

'Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fmp_Reference' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fmp_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'id', which is of type str; 'min', which is of type int; 'max', which is of type int.

'fmp_Project' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ConfigState' defines the following possible values: 'MACHINE_ELIMINATED', 'USER_SELECTED', 'MACHINE_SELECTED', 'UNDECIDED', 'USER_ELIMINATED'.
The enumeration 'ValueType' defines the following possible values: 'STRING', 'FLOAT', 'FEATURE', 'INTEGER', 'NONE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fmp_Feature' is a specialization of 'Clonable'.
The class 'fmp_FeatureGroup' is a specialization of 'Node'.
The class 'fmp_Reference' is a specialization of 'Clonable'.
The class 'fmp_Clonable' is a specialization of 'Node'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fmp_Feature' and 'fmp_Feature'. From 'fmp_Feature', the role 'fmp_Feature' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fmp_Feature', the role 'fmp_Feature0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fmp_Reference' and 'fmp_Feature'. From 'fmp_Reference', the role 'Reference' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fmp_Feature', the role 'feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fmp_Feature' and 'fmp_TypedValue'. From 'fmp_Feature', the role 'fmp_Feature4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fmp_TypedValue', the role 'fmp_TypedValue' has cardinality 0..*.
