Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Mode' defines the following possible values: 'Automatic', 'Manual'.
The enumeration 'AbstractionLevel' defines the following possible values: 'UNSPECIFIED', 'ANNOTATION', 'CIM', 'PSM', 'PDM', 'PIM', 'CODE'.
The enumeration 'ModelType' defines the following possible values: 'Both', 'Target', 'Source', 'None'.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'Annotation', 'Transformation'.
The enumeration 'Aspect' defines the following possible values: 'Quality', 'Architecture', 'Unspecified', 'Interface', 'Content', 'Behaviour', 'Semantics'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'iTrace_M2MLink' is a specialization of 'TraceLink'.
The class 'iTrace_M2TLink' is a specialization of 'TraceLink'.
The class 'iTrace_Code' is a specialization of 'Artefact'.
The class 'iTrace_Model' is a specialization of 'Artefact'.
The class 'iTrace_SourceElement' is a specialization of 'TraceLinkElement'.
The class 'iTrace_TargetElement' is a specialization of 'TraceLinkElement'.
