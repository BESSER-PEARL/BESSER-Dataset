The domain model 'complexStateMachineMetaModel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'complexStateMachineMetaModel_ComplexStateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

'complexStateMachineMetaModel_CompositeState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'complexStateMachineMetaModel_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

'complexStateMachineMetaModel_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'complexStateMachineMetaModel_CompositeState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
