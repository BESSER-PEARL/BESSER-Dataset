An association connects 'bowling_Tournament' and 'bowling_Matchup'. From 'bowling_Tournament', the role 'bowling_Tournament' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_Matchup', the role 'bowling_Matchup' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bowling_Matchup' and 'bowling_Game'. From 'bowling_Matchup', the role 'bowling_Matchup3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_Game', the role 'bowling_Game' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bowling_Player' and 'bowling_Game'. From 'bowling_Player', the role 'bowling_Player6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_Game', the role 'bowling_Game5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'bowling_League' and 'bowling_Alley'. From 'bowling_League', the role 'bowling_League8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'bowling_Alley', the role 'bowling_Alley' has cardinality 0..*.
