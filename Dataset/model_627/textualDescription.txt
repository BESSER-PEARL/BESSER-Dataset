The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model_TableContentWithoutValidation' is a specialization of 'TableContent'.
The class 'model_TableContentWithValidation' is a specialization of 'TableContent'.
The class 'model_TableContentWithInnerChild2' is a specialization of 'TableContent'.
The class 'model_TableContentWithInnerChild' is a specialization of 'TableContent'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
