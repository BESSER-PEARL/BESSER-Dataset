The domain model 'ra' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'ra_StudyPlan' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ra_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'ra_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'totalPoints', which is of type float; 'semesterNumber', which is of type int.

'ra_Programme' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mCode', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'ra_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'code', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'ra_MandatoryCourse' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'mandatory', which is of type bool; 'credit', which is of type float.

'ra_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'programmeCode' defines the following possible values: 'Datateknologi5', 'Datateknologi2', 'Informatikk'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ra_Programme' and 'ra_Department'. From 'ra_Programme', the role 'ra_Programme' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ra_Department', the role 'ra_Department' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ra_Course' and 'ra_Department'. From 'ra_Course', the role 'ra_Course' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ra_Department', the role 'ra_Department2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ra_Department' and 'ra_StudyPlan'. From 'ra_Department', the role 'ra_Department4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ra_StudyPlan', the role 'ra_StudyPlan' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'ra_Specialization' and 'ra_Department'. From 'ra_Specialization', the role 'ra_Specialization' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ra_Department', the role 'ra_Department6' has cardinality 0..*.
