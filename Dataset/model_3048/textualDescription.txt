The domain model 'myDsl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'myDsl_Attribute' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'myDsl_Reference' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'myDsl_Entity' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Feature' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Type' defines the following possible values: 'string', 'int'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'myDsl_Attribute' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'myDsl_Reference' is a specialization of 'Feature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_Model' and 'myDsl_Entity'. From 'myDsl_Model', the role 'myDsl_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Entity', the role 'myDsl_Entity' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Entity' and 'myDsl_Feature'. From 'myDsl_Entity', the role 'myDsl_Entity2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Feature', the role 'myDsl_Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_Entity' and 'myDsl_Reference'. From 'myDsl_Entity', the role 'myDsl_Entity4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_Reference', the role 'myDsl_Reference' has cardinality 0..*.
