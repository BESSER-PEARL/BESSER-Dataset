The domain model 'yyh' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'yyh_Bar' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'Baz' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyh_Bouz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'bil', which is of type str.

'yyh_Baz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'zig', which is of type str.

'yyh_Alias' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyh_Boul' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'hi', which is of type str.

'yyh_Output' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyh_Boz' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'yyh_Zing' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'yyh_Rel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'yyh_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'yyh_Base' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

'yyh_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'yyh_Base' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyh_Boz' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyh_Baz' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'yyh_Bouz' is a specialization of 'Baz'.
The class 'yyh_Boul' is a specialization of 'Baz'.
The class 'yyh_Zing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'yyh_Boz' and 'yyh_Base'. From 'yyh_Boz', the role 'Boz' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_Base', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyh_Foo' and 'yyh_Base'. From 'yyh_Foo', the role 'yyh_Foo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_Base', the role 'yyh_Base' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyh_Base' and 'yyh_Output'. From 'yyh_Base', the role 'yyh_Base3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_Output', the role 'yyh_Output' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyh_Base' and 'yyh_Baz'. From 'yyh_Base', the role 'yyh_Base5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_Baz', the role 'yyh_Baz' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyh_Alias' and 'yyh_NamedElement'. From 'yyh_Alias', the role 'yyh_Alias' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_NamedElement', the role 'yyh_NamedElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyh_NamedElement' and 'yyh_Bar'. From 'yyh_NamedElement', the role 'yyh_NamedElement8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_Bar', the role 'yyh_Bar' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'yyh_NamedElement' and 'yyh_Rel'. From 'yyh_NamedElement', the role 'yyh_NamedElement10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'yyh_Rel', the role 'yyh_Rel' has cardinality 0..*.
