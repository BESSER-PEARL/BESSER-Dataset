The domain model 'service' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 23 main class(es).

'service_BusinessOperation' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'OperationResultTypes' defines the following possible values: 'File', 'None'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'service_Service' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'service_Constant' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'service_Selection' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'service_Selection' is a specialization of 'FormalParameterList'.
The class 'service_ConstantReference' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'service_ServiceFeatureReference' is a specialization of 'Variable'.
The class 'service_Asc' is a specialization of 'Order'.
The class 'service_Desc' is a specialization of 'Order'.
The class 'service_BusinessOperation' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'service_BusinessOperation' is a specialization of 'FormalParameterList'.
The class 'service_Filter' is a specialization of 'NamedDisplayElement'.
The class 'service_Filter' is a specialization of 'FormalParameterList'.
