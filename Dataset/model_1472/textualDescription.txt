Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Operator' defines the following possible values: 'AND', 'IMPLIES', 'NOT', 'OR'.
The enumeration 'Quantifier' defines the following possible values: 'FORALL', 'EXISTS'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'GraphConstraint_Node' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'GraphConstraint_Edge' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'GraphConstraint_Attribute' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'GraphConstraint_QuantifiedGraphCondition' is a specialization of 'NestedGraphCondition'.
The class 'GraphConstraint_True' is a specialization of 'NestedGraphCondition'.
The class 'GraphConstraint_Formula' is a specialization of 'NestedGraphCondition'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
