The domain model 'autopl' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'autopl_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'probability', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'autopl_Alphabet' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'autopl_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'isFinal', which is of type str; 'isInitial', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'autopl_Automaton' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'autopl_HierarchicalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'autopl_Symbol' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AcceptanceKind' defines the following possible values: 'Probabilistic', 'Infinite', 'Finite'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'autopl_HierarchicalState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'autopl_Automaton' and 'autopl_Alphabet'. From 'autopl_Automaton', the role 'autopl_Automaton' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'autopl_Alphabet', the role 'autopl_Alphabet' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'autopl_Alphabet' and 'autopl_Automaton'. From 'autopl_Alphabet', the role 'autopl_Alphabet3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'autopl_Automaton', the role 'autopl_Automaton2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'autopl_Alphabet' and 'autopl_Automaton'. From 'autopl_Alphabet', the role 'autopl_Alphabet6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'autopl_Automaton', the role 'autopl_Automaton5' has cardinality 0..*.
