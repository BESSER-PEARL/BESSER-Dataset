The domain model 'UmlMM' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'UmlMM_UmlPackage' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'UmlMM_Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'UmlMM_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'UmlMM_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Classifier' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'UmlMM_Class' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'UmlMM_Property' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'upper', which is of type int; 'lower', which is of type int.

'UmlMM_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'UmlMM_DataType' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'UmlMM_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UmlMM_UmlPackage' and 'UmlMM_Classifier'. From 'UmlMM_UmlPackage', the role '_UmlPackage' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Classifier', the role 'Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_UmlPackage' and 'UmlMM_Classifier'. From 'UmlMM_UmlPackage', the role 'UmlPackage' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Classifier', the role 'elements' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_Class' and 'UmlMM_Operation'. From 'UmlMM_Class', the role '_Class' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Operation', the role 'Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_Class' and 'UmlMM_Property'. From 'UmlMM_Class', the role '_Class4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Property', the role 'Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_Operation' and 'UmlMM_Class'. From 'UmlMM_Operation', the role 'operation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_Operation' and 'UmlMM_Parameter'. From 'UmlMM_Operation', the role '_Operation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Parameter', the role 'Parameter' has cardinality 0..*.

An association connects 'UmlMM_Parameter' and 'UmlMM_Operation'. From 'UmlMM_Parameter', the role 'parameter' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Operation', the role 'Operation9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_Property' and 'UmlMM_Classifier'. From 'UmlMM_Property', the role 'UmlMM_Property' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Classifier', the role 'UmlMM_Classifier11' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UmlMM_Class' and 'UmlMM_Property'. From 'UmlMM_Class', the role 'Class13' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UmlMM_Property', the role '_property' has cardinality 0..*.
