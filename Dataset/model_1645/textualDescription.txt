The domain model 'kwas' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'kwas_Top' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kwas_Tree' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'valsI', which is of type int; 'labelS', which is of type str; 'valsS', which is of type int; 'labelI', which is of type str.

'Tree' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kwas_Bin' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'kwas_Leaf' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'val', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'kwas_Bin' is a specialization of 'Tree'.
The class 'kwas_Leaf' is a specialization of 'Tree'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'kwas_Tree' and 'kwas_Top'. From 'kwas_Tree', the role 'kwas_Tree' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kwas_Top', the role 'kwas_Top' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kwas_Tree' and 'kwas_Bin'. From 'kwas_Tree', the role 'kwas_Tree2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kwas_Bin', the role 'kwas_Bin' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'kwas_Tree' and 'kwas_Bin'. From 'kwas_Tree', the role 'kwas_Tree5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'kwas_Bin', the role 'kwas_Bin4' has cardinality 0..*.
