The domain model 'Trmodel' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 9 main class(es).

'Trmodel_Update' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'newName', which is of type str.

'Trmodel_Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Trmodel_Delete' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Trmodel_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'tableName', which is of type str; 'Name', which is of type str.

'Operation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Trmodel_Add' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Trmodel_loader' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Trmodel_LoadModel' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'url', which is of type str.

'Trmodel_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'Trmodel_Add' is a specialization of 'Operation'.
The class 'Trmodel_Delete' is a specialization of 'Operation'.
The class 'Trmodel_Update' is a specialization of 'Operation'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'Trmodel_loader' and 'Trmodel_Operation'. From 'Trmodel_loader', the role 'Trmodel_loader' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Trmodel_Operation', the role 'Trmodel_Operation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Trmodel_loader' and 'Trmodel_LoadModel'. From 'Trmodel_loader', the role 'Trmodel_loader2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Trmodel_LoadModel', the role 'Trmodel_LoadModel' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Trmodel_Operation' and 'Trmodel_Table'. From 'Trmodel_Operation', the role 'Trmodel_Operation4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Trmodel_Table', the role 'Trmodel_Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'Trmodel_Operation' and 'Trmodel_Column'. From 'Trmodel_Operation', the role 'Trmodel_Operation6' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'Trmodel_Column', the role 'Trmodel_Column' has cardinality 0..*.
