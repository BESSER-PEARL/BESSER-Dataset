The domain model 'simpleGraph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'simpleGraph_GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'generated', which is of type bool; 'id', which is of type int.

'GraphElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Position' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleGraph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleGraph_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleGraph_Label' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type str.

'simpleGraph_Nail' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simpleGraph_Position' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'X', which is of type int; 'Y', which is of type int.

'simpleGraph_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'value', which is of type str; 'key', which is of type str.

'simpleGraph_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simpleGraph_Graph' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'simpleGraph_Position' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'simpleGraph_Edge' is a specialization of 'GraphElement'.
The class 'simpleGraph_Node' is a specialization of 'Position'.
The class 'simpleGraph_Label' is a specialization of 'Position'.
The class 'simpleGraph_Nail' is a specialization of 'Position'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
