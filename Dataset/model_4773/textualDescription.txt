Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'PropertyStorageModifier' defines the following possible values: 'TRANSIENT', 'VARIABLE', 'VALUE'.
The enumeration 'EntityRelationshipKind' defines the following possible values: 'UNIQUE', 'MANY'.
The enumeration 'TypeStorageModifier' defines the following possible values: 'STORABLE', 'EMBEDDABLE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
