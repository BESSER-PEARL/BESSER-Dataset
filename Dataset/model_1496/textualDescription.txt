The domain model 'PetriNet' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Element' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'PetriNet_Element' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'PetriNet_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'minTime', which is of type int; 'maxTime', which is of type int.

'PetriNet_Place' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'Tokens', which is of type int.

'PetriNet_Arc' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'PetriNet_Place' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'PetriNet_Transition' is a specialization of 'Element'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot' and 'PetriNet_Element'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot', the role 'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'PetriNet_Element' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot', the role 'PetriNet_PetriNetRoot2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Arc' and 'PetriNet_Element'. From 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'PetriNet_Element5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'PetriNet_Element' and 'PetriNet_Arc'. From 'PetriNet_Element', the role 'PetriNet_Element8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'PetriNet_Arc', the role 'PetriNet_Arc7' has cardinality 0..*.
