The model defines 5 main class(es).

'myDsl_Model' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'myDsl_AbstractGreeting' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The class 'myDsl_GreetingReference' is a specialization of 'AbstractGreeting'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'myDsl_Model' and 'myDsl_AbstractGreeting'. From 'myDsl_Model', the role 'myDsl_Model' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_AbstractGreeting', the role 'myDsl_AbstractGreeting' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'myDsl_GreetingReference' and 'myDsl_AbstractGreeting'. From 'myDsl_GreetingReference', the role 'myDsl_GreetingReference' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'myDsl_AbstractGreeting', the role 'myDsl_AbstractGreeting2' has cardinality 0..*.
