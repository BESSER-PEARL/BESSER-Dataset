Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VisibilityEnum' defines the following possible values: 'private', 'public'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'oml_Model' is a specialization of 'Package'.
The class 'oml_PackageableElement' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'oml_NamedElement' is a specialization of 'AnnotatedElement'.
The class 'oml_Package' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.
The class 'oml_Classifier' is a specialization of 'PackageableElement'.
The class 'oml_ExternalClass' is a specialization of 'Class'.
The class 'oml_Class' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'oml_Datatype' is a specialization of 'Classifier'.
The class 'oml_Feature' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'oml_StructuralFeature' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'oml_Operation' is a specialization of 'Feature'.
The class 'oml_Parameter' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'oml_Reference' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.
The class 'oml_Attribute' is a specialization of 'StructuralFeature'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'oml_Package' and 'oml_PackageableElement'. From 'oml_Package', the role 'Package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oml_PackageableElement', the role 'contents' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oml_AnnotatedElement' and 'oml_Annotation'. From 'oml_AnnotatedElement', the role 'oml_AnnotatedElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oml_Annotation', the role 'oml_Annotation' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oml_Package' and 'oml_PackageableElement'. From 'oml_Package', the role 'package' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oml_PackageableElement', the role 'PackageableElement' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oml_Class' and 'oml_Class'. From 'oml_Class', the role 'extendedBy' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oml_Class', the role 'Class' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oml_Class' and 'oml_Class'. From 'oml_Class', the role 'Class7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oml_Class', the role 'extends' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oml_Class' and 'oml_Feature'. From 'oml_Class', the role 'owner' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oml_Feature', the role 'Feature' has cardinality 0..*.
