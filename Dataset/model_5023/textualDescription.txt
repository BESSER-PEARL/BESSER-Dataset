The domain model 'model1' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 15 main class(es).

'model1_ProductToOrder' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Address' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model1_Company' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model1_PurchaseOrder' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'date', which is of type date.

'model1_Order' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'model1_Product1' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'vat', which is of type str; 'description', which is of type str; 'otherVATs', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'OrderDetail' represents an important domain concept.

'model1_Address' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'city', which is of type str; 'street', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'VAT' defines the following possible values: 'vat0', 'vat7', 'vat15'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'model1_Company' is a specialization of 'Address'.
The class 'model1_Supplier' is a specialization of 'Address'.
The class 'model1_Customer' is a specialization of 'Address'.
The class 'model1_PurchaseOrder' is a specialization of 'Order'.
The class 'model1_SalesOrder' is a specialization of 'Order'.
The class 'model1_OrderAddress' is a specialization of 'Address'.
The class 'model1_OrderAddress' is a specialization of 'Order'.
The class 'model1_OrderAddress' is a specialization of 'OrderDetail'.
