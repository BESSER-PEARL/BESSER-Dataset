The domain model 'y2fsm' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'y2fsm_Foo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'y2fsm_AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type str.

'AbstractState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'y2fsm_Region' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'y2fsm_Region' is a specialization of 'AbstractState'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'y2fsm_AbstractState' and 'y2fsm_Region'. From 'y2fsm_AbstractState', the role 'y2fsm_AbstractState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'y2fsm_Region', the role 'y2fsm_Region' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'y2fsm_Foo' and 'y2fsm_Region'. From 'y2fsm_Foo', the role 'y2fsm_Foo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'y2fsm_Region', the role 'y2fsm_Region2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'y2fsm_AbstractState' and 'y2fsm_Foo'. From 'y2fsm_AbstractState', the role 'y2fsm_AbstractState4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'y2fsm_Foo', the role 'y2fsm_Foo5' has cardinality 0..*.
