The domain model 'simplek' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'simplek_Base' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'simplek_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplek_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'simplek_Content' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'simplek_Content' and 'simplek_Base'. From 'simplek_Content', the role 'simplek_Content' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplek_Base', the role 'simplek_Base' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplek_Content' and 'simplek_A'. From 'simplek_Content', the role 'simplek_Content2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplek_A', the role 'simplek_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'simplek_B' and 'simplek_Content'. From 'simplek_B', the role 'simplek_B' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'simplek_Content', the role 'simplek_Content4' has cardinality 0..*.
