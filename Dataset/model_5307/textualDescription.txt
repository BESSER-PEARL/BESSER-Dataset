The domain model 'typeB' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'typeB_DefinitionB' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'typeB_RootB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'typeB_ElementB' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'typeB_ElementB' and 'typeB_RootB'. From 'typeB_ElementB', the role 'typeB_ElementB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeB_RootB', the role 'typeB_RootB' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'typeB_DefinitionB' and 'typeB_RootB'. From 'typeB_DefinitionB', the role 'typeB_DefinitionB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeB_RootB', the role 'typeB_RootB2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'typeB_ElementB' and 'typeB_DefinitionB'. From 'typeB_ElementB', the role 'typeB_ElementB4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'typeB_DefinitionB', the role 'typeB_DefinitionB5' has cardinality 0..*.
