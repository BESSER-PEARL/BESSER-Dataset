Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'MarkerKind' defines the following possible values: 'THRESHOLDREACHED', 'EXTERNALEVENT', 'ACTIONNEEDED', 'value', 'INTERNALEVENT'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'operators_EquipmentRelationship' is a specialization of 'Relationship'.
The class 'operators_FunctionRelationship' is a specialization of 'Relationship'.
The class 'operators_Operator' is a specialization of 'Company'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
