The domain model 'relationworld' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 14 main class(es).

'relationworld_ThingB' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'step', which is of type str.

'relationworld_Arrow' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationworld_TargetNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TargetNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationworld_ThingA' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type date.

'relationworld_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationworld_SourceNode' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationworld_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'Arrow' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Category' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'relationworld_Category' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'nom', which is of type str.

'relationworld_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SourceNode' represents an important domain concept.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Scale' defines the following possible values: 'two', 'four', 'three', 'one', 'nothing'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'relationworld_ThingA' is a specialization of 'SourceNode'.
The class 'relationworld_ThingA' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'relationworld_ThingB' is a specialization of 'TargetNode'.
The class 'relationworld_ThingB' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'relationworld_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'Arrow'.
The class 'relationworld_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'relationworld_World' is a specialization of 'Category'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'relationworld_RelatedTo' and 'relationworld_ThingA'. From 'relationworld_RelatedTo', the role 'relationworld_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_ThingA', the role 'relationworld_ThingA' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_ThingB' and 'relationworld_RelatedTo'. From 'relationworld_ThingB', the role 'relationworld_ThingB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_RelatedTo', the role 'relationworld_RelatedTo2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_World' and 'relationworld_ThingA'. From 'relationworld_World', the role 'relationworld_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_ThingA', the role 'relationworld_ThingA4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_ThingB' and 'relationworld_World'. From 'relationworld_ThingB', the role 'relationworld_ThingB7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_World', the role 'relationworld_World6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_RelatedTo' and 'relationworld_World'. From 'relationworld_RelatedTo', the role 'relationworld_RelatedTo10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_World', the role 'relationworld_World9' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_SourceNode' and 'relationworld_Arrow'. From 'relationworld_SourceNode', the role 'relationworld_SourceNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_Arrow', the role 'relationworld_Arrow' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_TargetNode' and 'relationworld_Arrow'. From 'relationworld_TargetNode', the role 'relationworld_TargetNode' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_Arrow', the role 'relationworld_Arrow13' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_Category' and 'relationworld_SourceNode'. From 'relationworld_Category', the role 'relationworld_Category' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_SourceNode', the role 'relationworld_SourceNode15' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_Arrow' and 'relationworld_Category'. From 'relationworld_Arrow', the role 'relationworld_Arrow18' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_Category', the role 'relationworld_Category17' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'relationworld_Category' and 'relationworld_TargetNode'. From 'relationworld_Category', the role 'relationworld_Category20' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'relationworld_TargetNode', the role 'relationworld_TargetNode21' has cardinality 0..*.
