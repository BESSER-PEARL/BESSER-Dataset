The domain model 'rdbms' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'rdbms_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbms_RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'kind', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'rdbms_ForeignKey' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbms_Key' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdbms_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'type', which is of type str.

'rdbms_Schema' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'rdbms_Column' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbms_ForeignKey' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbms_Key' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbms_Schema' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.
The class 'rdbms_Table' is a specialization of 'RModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rdbms_Column' and 'rdbms_Table'. From 'rdbms_Column', the role 'columns' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbms_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbms_Column' and 'rdbms_ForeignKey'. From 'rdbms_Column', the role 'columns2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbms_ForeignKey', the role 'ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbms_Column' and 'rdbms_Key'. From 'rdbms_Column', the role 'column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbms_Key', the role 'Key' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbms_Key' and 'rdbms_ForeignKey'. From 'rdbms_Key', the role 'rdbms_Key' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbms_ForeignKey', the role 'rdbms_ForeignKey' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbms_Column' and 'rdbms_ForeignKey'. From 'rdbms_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbms_ForeignKey', the role 'foreignKeys' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdbms_Table' and 'rdbms_ForeignKey'. From 'rdbms_Table', the role 'Table8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdbms_ForeignKey', the role 'foreignKeys7' has cardinality 0..*.
