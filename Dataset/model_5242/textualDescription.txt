The domain model 'sbase' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 7 main class(es).

'sbase_SRoot' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sbase_SElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sbase_Y' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'sbase_X' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'sbase_EObject' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'sbase_Z' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'sbase_X' is a specialization of 'SElement'.
The class 'sbase_Y' is a specialization of 'SElement'.
The class 'sbase_Z' is a specialization of 'SElement'.
The class 'sbase_SRoot' is a specialization of 'SElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'sbase_Y' and 'sbase_X'. From 'sbase_Y', the role 'Y' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sbase_X', the role 'toX' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sbase_Z' and 'sbase_Y'. From 'sbase_Z', the role 'Z' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sbase_Y', the role 'toY' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sbase_X' and 'sbase_Y'. From 'sbase_X', the role 'X' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sbase_Y', the role 'ownsY' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sbase_Y' and 'sbase_Z'. From 'sbase_Y', the role 'Y4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sbase_Z', the role 'ownsZ' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sbase_SRoot' and 'sbase_X'. From 'sbase_SRoot', the role 'sbase_SRoot' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sbase_X', the role 'sbase_X' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'sbase_SElement' and 'sbase_EObject'. From 'sbase_SElement', the role 'sbase_SElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'sbase_EObject', the role 'sbase_EObject' has cardinality 0..*.
