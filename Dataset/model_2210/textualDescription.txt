The domain model 'StudyProgrammes' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 6 main class(es).

'StudyProgrammes_Programme' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semestersBeforeSpecialization', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str; 'startYear', which is of type int; 'totalNumberOfSemesters', which is of type int; 'code', which is of type str.

'StudyProgrammes_Semester' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'semesterSeason', which is of type str; 'year', which is of type int; 'code', which is of type str.

'StudyProgrammes_Department' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'StudyProgrammes_Course' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'credits', which is of type float; 'availableSemesters', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str; 'code', which is of type str.

'StudyProgrammes_CourseAccess' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'access', which is of type str.

'StudyProgrammes_Specialization' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'lengthInSemesters', which is of type int; 'startSemester', which is of type int.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'SemesterSeason' defines the following possible values: 'Spring', 'Fall'.
The enumeration 'Access' defines the following possible values: 'M2A', 'NA', 'M1A', 'VA', 'O'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
