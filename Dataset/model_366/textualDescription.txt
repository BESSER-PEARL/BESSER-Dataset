The domain model 'lib' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'lib_Writer' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'lib_Library' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'location', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'lib_Book' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'title', which is of type str; 'pages', which is of type int; 'category', which is of type str.

'lib_LibSys' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'BookCategory' defines the following possible values: 'GeneralFiction', 'Biography', 'SciFi', 'NonFiction'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'lib_Writer' and 'lib_Library'. From 'lib_Writer', the role 'lib_Writer' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lib_Library', the role 'lib_Library' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lib_Library' and 'lib_Book'. From 'lib_Library', the role 'lib_Library2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lib_Book', the role 'lib_Book' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lib_Writer' and 'lib_Book'. From 'lib_Writer', the role 'lib_Writer5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lib_Book', the role 'lib_Book4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lib_Library' and 'lib_LibSys'. From 'lib_Library', the role 'lib_Library7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lib_LibSys', the role 'lib_LibSys' has cardinality 0..*.
