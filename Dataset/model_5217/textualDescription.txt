The domain model 'TypeB' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'TypeB_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeB_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'TypeB_C' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'TypeB_A' and 'TypeB_B'. From 'TypeB_A', the role 'TypeB_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeB_B', the role 'TypeB_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'TypeB_A' and 'TypeB_B'. From 'TypeB_A', the role 'TypeB_A3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'TypeB_B', the role 'TypeB_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
