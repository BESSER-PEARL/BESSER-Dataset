The domain model 'fiacre' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'fiacre_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fiacre_Init' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fiacre_DataType' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fiacre_Component' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ID', which is of type str.

'fiacre_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ID', which is of type str.

'fiacre_Program' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'EModelElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fiacre_Process' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ID', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'fiacre_Variable' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'ID', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'fiacre_State' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'fiacre_Process' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'fiacre_Transition' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'fiacre_DataType' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'fiacre_Variable' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'fiacre_Init' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'fiacre_Component' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.
The class 'fiacre_Program' is a specialization of 'EModelElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'fiacre_State' and 'fiacre_Transition'. From 'fiacre_State', the role 'state' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fiacre_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fiacre_Process' and 'fiacre_State'. From 'fiacre_Process', the role 'fiacre_Process' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fiacre_State', the role 'fiacre_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fiacre_Process' and 'fiacre_Transition'. From 'fiacre_Process', the role 'fiacre_Process3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fiacre_Transition', the role 'fiacre_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fiacre_Variable' and 'fiacre_Process'. From 'fiacre_Variable', the role 'Variable' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fiacre_Process', the role 'process' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'fiacre_State' and 'fiacre_Transition'. From 'fiacre_State', the role 'State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'fiacre_Transition', the role 'transition' has cardinality 0..*.
