Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'UML2_Association' and 'UML2_Property'. From 'UML2_Association', the role 'UML2_Association' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_Property', the role 'UML2_Property' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_Generalization' and 'UML2_Classifier'. From 'UML2_Generalization', the role 'UML2_Generalization' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_Classifier', the role 'UML2_Classifier' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'UML2_Generalization' and 'UML2_Classifier'. From 'UML2_Generalization', the role 'UML2_Generalization3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'UML2_Classifier', the role 'UML2_Classifier4' has cardinality 0..*.
