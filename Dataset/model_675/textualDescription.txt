The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'oclstdlib_Collection' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclComparable' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclElement' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclInvalid' is a specialization of 'OclVoid'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclLambda' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclMessage' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclState' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclSummable' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclTuple' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclType' is a specialization of 'OclElement'.
The class 'oclstdlib_OclVoid' is a specialization of 'OclAny'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'oclstdlib_OclElement' and 'oclstdlib_OclElement'. From 'oclstdlib_OclElement', the role 'oclstdlib_OclElement' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstdlib_OclElement', the role 'oclstdlib_OclElement0' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstdlib_OclElement' and 'oclstdlib_OclElement'. From 'oclstdlib_OclElement', the role 'oclstdlib_OclElement4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstdlib_OclElement', the role 'oclstdlib_OclElement2' has cardinality 0..*.
