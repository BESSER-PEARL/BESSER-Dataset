The domain model 'visualworld' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'visualworld_NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'visualworld_World' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'visualworld_RelatedTo' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'since', which is of type str.

'NamedElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'visualworld_Thing' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'id', which is of type int.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'visualworld_Thing' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.
The class 'visualworld_RelatedTo' is a specialization of 'NamedElement'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'visualworld_World' and 'visualworld_Thing'. From 'visualworld_World', the role 'visualworld_World' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'visualworld_Thing', the role 'visualworld_Thing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'visualworld_RelatedTo' and 'visualworld_Thing'. From 'visualworld_RelatedTo', the role 'RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'visualworld_Thing', the role 'fromThing' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'visualworld_Thing' and 'visualworld_RelatedTo'. From 'visualworld_Thing', the role 'Thing' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'visualworld_RelatedTo', the role 'relations' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'visualworld_Thing' and 'visualworld_RelatedTo'. From 'visualworld_Thing', the role 'visualworld_Thing4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'visualworld_RelatedTo', the role 'visualworld_RelatedTo' has cardinality 0..*.
