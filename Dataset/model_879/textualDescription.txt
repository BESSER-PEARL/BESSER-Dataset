'simplepdl_Parameter' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'nbNeeds', which is of type int; 'name', which is of type str.

'ProcessElement' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'WorkSequenceType' defines the following possible values: 'startToFinish', 'finishToFinish', 'startToStart', 'finishToStart'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'simplepdl_Guidance' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_WorkSequence' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_Activities' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_WorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'Activities'.
The class 'simplepdl_SubWorkDefinition' is a specialization of 'Activities'.
The class 'simplepdl_Parameter' is a specialization of 'ProcessElement'.
The class 'simplepdl_ParameterWD' is a specialization of 'Parameter'.
The class 'simplepdl_ParameterSWD' is a specialization of 'Parameter'.
