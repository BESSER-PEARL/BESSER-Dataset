The domain model 'a' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'a_B' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'a_Root' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'visible', which is of type bool.

'SuperStuff' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'SuperStuff2' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'a_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'a_A' is a specialization of 'SuperStuff'.
The class 'a_A' is a specialization of 'SuperStuff2'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'a_Root' and 'a_A'. From 'a_Root', the role 'a_Root' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_A', the role 'a_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_A' and 'a_Root'. From 'a_A', the role 'a_A3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_Root', the role 'a_Root2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_Root' and 'a_B'. From 'a_Root', the role 'a_Root5' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_B', the role 'a_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'a_B' and 'a_A'. From 'a_B', the role 'a_B8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'a_A', the role 'a_A7' has cardinality 0..*.
