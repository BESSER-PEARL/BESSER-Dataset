The domain model 'oclstates' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 8 main class(es).

'oclstates_Event' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'oclstates_Statemachine' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'name', which is of type str; 'value', which is of type int; 'initial', which is of type bool.

'oclstates_CompoundState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'oclstates_SimpleState' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'value', which is of type int.

'oclstates_Transition' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'oclstates_State' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'initial', which is of type bool; 'name', which is of type str.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'oclstates_Module' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'oclstates_SimpleState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'oclstates_CompoundState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'oclstates_Statemachine' and 'oclstates_Module'. From 'oclstates_Statemachine', the role 'oclstates_Statemachine' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstates_Module', the role 'oclstates_Module' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstates_Statemachine' and 'oclstates_Event'. From 'oclstates_Statemachine', the role 'oclstates_Statemachine2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstates_Event', the role 'oclstates_Event' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstates_Statemachine' and 'oclstates_State'. From 'oclstates_Statemachine', the role 'oclstates_Statemachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstates_State', the role 'oclstates_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstates_Transition' and 'oclstates_State'. From 'oclstates_Transition', the role 'oclstates_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstates_State', the role 'oclstates_State6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'oclstates_State' and 'oclstates_Statemachine'. From 'oclstates_State', the role 'oclstates_State8' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'oclstates_Statemachine', the role 'oclstates_Statemachine9' has cardinality 0..*.
