The domain model 'rdb' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 10 main class(es).

'rdb_Table' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'constraints', which is of type str; 'logicalName', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'schema', which is of type str; 'name', which is of type str.

'rdb_Relation' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'referenced_column_name', which is of type str; 'constraint_name', which is of type str; 'target_kind', which is of type str; 'source_kind', which is of type str; 'bendpoint', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'column_name', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str.

'Table' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdb_UserComment' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'comment', which is of type str.

'rdb_ERDInfo' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'autoLayout', which is of type bool; 'version', which is of type str.

'rdb_DB' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'url', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str; 'sid', which is of type str; 'key', which is of type str; 'id', which is of type str; 'dbType', which is of type str.

'rdb_View' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdb_Column' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'key', which is of type str; 'type', which is of type str; 'extra', which is of type str; 'null', which is of type str; 'logicalField', which is of type str; 'field', which is of type str; 'default', which is of type str; 'comment', which is of type str.

'ERDInfo' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'rdb_Style' represents an important domain concept.
It has the following attributes: 'columnNullCheck', which is of type str; 'columnComment', which is of type str; 'scale', which is of type str; 'columnPrimaryKey', which is of type str; 'grid', which is of type str; 'tableTitle', which is of type str; 'columnType', which is of type str; 'columnName', which is of type str.

Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'RelationKind' defines the following possible values: 'ZERO_OR_MANY', 'ZERO_OR_ONE', 'ONLY_ONE', 'ONE_OR_MANY'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'rdb_DB' is a specialization of 'ERDInfo'.
The class 'rdb_View' is a specialization of 'Table'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'rdb_DB' and 'rdb_Table'. From 'rdb_DB', the role 'db' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdb_Table', the role 'Table' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdb_Relation' and 'rdb_DB'. From 'rdb_Relation', the role 'Relation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdb_DB', the role 'db2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdb_UserComment' and 'rdb_DB'. From 'rdb_UserComment', the role 'rdb_UserComment' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdb_DB', the role 'rdb_DB' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdb_Style' and 'rdb_DB'. From 'rdb_Style', the role 'Style' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdb_DB', the role 'db5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdb_Table' and 'rdb_Column'. From 'rdb_Table', the role 'table' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdb_Column', the role 'Column' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'rdb_DB' and 'rdb_Table'. From 'rdb_DB', the role 'DB' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'rdb_Table', the role 'tables' has cardinality 0..*.
