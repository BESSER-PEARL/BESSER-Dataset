The model defines 11 main class(es).

'lts2_StateMachine' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'TransitionalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'lts2_LTSGenerator' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'State' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'lts2_FinalState' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'UseCaseStep' represents an important domain concept.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'lts2_InitialState' is a specialization of 'TransitionalState'.
The class 'lts2_FinalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'lts2_TransitionalState' is a specialization of 'State'.
The class 'lts2_AbortState' is a specialization of 'State'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'lts2_InitialState' and 'lts2_StateMachine'. From 'lts2_InitialState', the role 'lts2_InitialState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lts2_StateMachine', the role 'lts2_StateMachine' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lts2_TransitionalState' and 'lts2_StateMachine'. From 'lts2_TransitionalState', the role 'lts2_TransitionalState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lts2_StateMachine', the role 'lts2_StateMachine2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lts2_StateMachine' and 'lts2_FinalState'. From 'lts2_StateMachine', the role 'lts2_StateMachine4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lts2_FinalState', the role 'lts2_FinalState' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lts2_AbortState' and 'lts2_StateMachine'. From 'lts2_AbortState', the role 'lts2_AbortState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lts2_StateMachine', the role 'lts2_StateMachine6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lts2_TransitionalState' and 'lts2_Transition'. From 'lts2_TransitionalState', the role 'sourceState' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lts2_Transition', the role 'Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'lts2_State' and 'lts2_Transition'. From 'lts2_State', the role 'lts2_State' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'lts2_Transition', the role 'lts2_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
