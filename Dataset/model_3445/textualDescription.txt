The domain model 'schol' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'schol_School' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'schol_Classroom' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'schol_Student' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'schol_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'schol_Student' and 'schol_Classroom'. From 'schol_Student', the role 'schol_Student' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schol_Classroom', the role 'schol_Classroom' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'schol_Diagram' and 'schol_School'. From 'schol_Diagram', the role 'schol_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schol_School', the role 'schol_School' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'schol_School' and 'schol_Classroom'. From 'schol_School', the role 'schol_School3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schol_Classroom', the role 'schol_Classroom4' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'schol_Student' and 'schol_Student'. From 'schol_Student', the role 'schol_Student7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'schol_Student', the role 'schol_Student5' has cardinality 0..*.
