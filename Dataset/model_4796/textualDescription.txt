Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'AEnum' defines the following possible values: 'ENUM0', 'ENUM1'.
The enumeration 'Heavy' defines the following possible values: 'OPEN3', 'DELETE1', 'OPEN2', 'OPEN1', 'CLOSE4', 'CLOSE2', 'DELETE4', 'MOVE', 'OPEN4', 'CLOSE', 'DELETE', 'CLOSE3', 'MOVE2', 'MOVE1', 'MOVE3', 'MOVING3', 'MOVING4', 'DELETE3', 'MOVE4', 'CLOS1E', 'OPEN', 'MOVING', 'DELETE2', 'MOVING2', 'MOVING1'.
The enumeration 'StateWithoutDefault' defines the following possible values: 'OPEN', 'MOVING', 'CLOSE', 'MOVE', 'DELETE'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'alldatatypes_Root' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Type' is a specialization of 'Element'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Strings' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Dates' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Enums' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Booleans' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Integers' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Longs' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Shorts' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Doubles' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_Floats' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_BigIntegers' is a specialization of 'Type'.
The class 'alldatatypes_BigDecimals' is a specialization of 'Type'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'alldatatypes_Type' and 'alldatatypes_Root'. From 'alldatatypes_Type', the role 'alldatatypes_Type' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'alldatatypes_Root', the role 'alldatatypes_Root' has cardinality 0..*.
