The domain model 'tree' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 3 main class(es).

'tree_Node' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'tree_Diagram' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'tree_Edge' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'tree_Diagram' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Diagram', the role 'tree_Diagram' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Edge' and 'tree_Diagram'. From 'tree_Edge', the role 'tree_Edge' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Diagram', the role 'tree_Diagram2' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Node' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node5' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Edge' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Edge', the role 'tree_Edge7' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'tree_Edge' and 'tree_Node'. From 'tree_Edge', the role 'tree_Edge10' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'tree_Node', the role 'tree_Node11' has cardinality 0..*.
