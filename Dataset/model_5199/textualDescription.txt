The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ModeleTp3_pack2_D' is a specialization of 'C'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'pack1_ModeleTp3_Int' and 'ModeleTp3_pack1_A'. From 'pack1_ModeleTp3_Int', the role 'pack1_ModeleTp3_Int' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ModeleTp3_pack1_A', the role 'ModeleTp3_pack1_A' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'pack2_ModeleTp3_Int' and 'ModeleTp3_pack2_E'. From 'pack2_ModeleTp3_Int', the role 'pack2_ModeleTp3_Int' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ModeleTp3_pack2_E', the role 'ModeleTp3_pack2_E' has cardinality 0..*.
