It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'automata_Final' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'automata_Current' and 'automata_Automata'. From 'automata_Current', the role 'automata_Current' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automata_Automata', the role 'automata_Automata' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automata_Automata' and 'automata_Initial'. From 'automata_Automata', the role 'automata_Automata2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automata_Initial', the role 'automata_Initial' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automata_Automata' and 'automata_State'. From 'automata_Automata', the role 'automata_Automata4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automata_State', the role 'automata_State' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automata_Transition' and 'automata_Automata'. From 'automata_Transition', the role 'automata_Transition' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automata_Automata', the role 'automata_Automata6' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automata_Final' and 'automata_Automata'. From 'automata_Final', the role 'automata_Final' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automata_Automata', the role 'automata_Automata8' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'automata_State' and 'automata_Transition'. From 'automata_State', the role 'automata_State11' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'automata_Transition', the role 'automata_Transition10' has cardinality 0..*.
