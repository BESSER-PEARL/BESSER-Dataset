Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'ScenarioKind' defines the following possible values: 'FUNCTIONAL', 'UNSET', 'INTERACTION', 'DATA_FLOW', 'INTERFACE'.
The enumeration 'InteractionOperatorKind' defines the following possible values: 'STRICT', 'ALT', 'IGNORE', 'UNSET', 'CRITICAL', 'LOOP', 'PAR', 'OPT', 'ASSERT', 'CONSIDER', 'NEG', 'SEQ'.
The enumeration 'MessageKind' defines the following possible values: 'REPLY', 'CREATE', 'DELETE', 'TIMER', 'SYNCHRONOUS_CALL', 'UNSET', 'ASYNCHRONOUS_CALL'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
