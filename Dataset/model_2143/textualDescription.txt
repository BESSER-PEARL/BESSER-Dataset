The domain model 'graph' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 2 main class(es).

'graph_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'graphName', which is of type str.

'graph_Vertex' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'internalId', which is of type str.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Vertex'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph_Graph' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Graph' and 'graph_Vertex'. From 'graph_Graph', the role 'graph_Graph2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex3' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'graph_Vertex' and 'graph_Vertex'. From 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex4' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'graph_Vertex', the role 'graph_Vertex6' has cardinality 0..*.
