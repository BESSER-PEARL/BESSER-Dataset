Enumerations define attributes whose values are restricted to a fixed set of well-defined literals.
The enumeration 'Cardinals' defines the following possible values: 'WEST', 'SOUTH', 'EAST', 'NORTH'.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'minilang_IfStmt' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'minilang_GreaterThan' is a specialization of 'Condition'.
The class 'minilang_Constant' is a specialization of 'Value'.
The class 'minilang_VariableRef' is a specialization of 'Value'.
The class 'minilang_VariableAffect' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'minilang_Sum' is a specialization of 'BinaryOperation'.
The class 'minilang_Modulo' is a specialization of 'BinaryOperation'.
The class 'minilang_BinaryOperation' is a specialization of 'Value'.
The class 'minilang_CallMethod' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'minilang_Move' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'minilang_RotateRight' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
The class 'minilang_RotateLeft' is a specialization of 'Statement'.
