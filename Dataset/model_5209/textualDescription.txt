The domain model 'ABC' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 5 main class(es).

'A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_C' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_A' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'ABC_D' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'ABC_B' is a specialization of 'A'.
The class 'ABC_C' is a specialization of 'A'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'ABC_A' and 'ABC_D'. From 'ABC_A', the role 'ABC_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'ABC_D', the role 'ABC_D' has cardinality 0..*.
