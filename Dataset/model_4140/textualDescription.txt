The class 'arithmetic_Plus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'arithmetic_Minus' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'arithmetic_Multi' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'arithmetic_Div' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'arithmetic_NumberLiteral' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
The class 'arithmetic_FunctionCall' is a specialization of 'Expression'.
