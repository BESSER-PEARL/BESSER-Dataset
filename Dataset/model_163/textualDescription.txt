Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Place'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Place', the role 'petrinet_Place' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_PetriNet' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_PetriNet', the role 'petrinet_PetriNet2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'petrinet_Transition' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'petrinet_TPArc' and 'petrinet_Transition'. From 'petrinet_TPArc', the role 'TPArc' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'petrinet_Transition', the role 'source' has cardinality 0..*.
