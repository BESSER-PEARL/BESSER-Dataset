The domain model 'in' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'in_A' represents an important domain concept.
It has one attribute: 'name', which is of type str.

'in_RootIn' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'RootIn' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'in_B' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'in_A' is a specialization of 'RootIn'.
The class 'in_B' is a specialization of 'RootIn'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'in_A' and 'in_B'. From 'in_A', the role 'in_A' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'in_B', the role 'in_B' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'in_A' and 'in_B'. From 'in_A', the role 'in_A3' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'in_B', the role 'in_B2' has cardinality 0..*.
