The domain model 'transform' describes the core structural elements and their relationships within the system.

The model defines 4 main class(es).

'transform_Transformation' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'transform_Grammar' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'Named' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

'transform_Graph' represents an important domain concept.
It does not declare any attributes.

The model also captures inheritance relationships between classes.
The class 'transform_Transformation' is a specialization of 'Named'.

Relationships between classes are modeled using associations.
An association connects 'transform_Transformation' and 'transform_Graph'. From 'transform_Transformation', the role 'transform_Transformation' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'transform_Graph', the role 'transform_Graph' has cardinality 0..*.
An association connects 'transform_Transformation' and 'transform_Grammar'. From 'transform_Transformation', the role 'transform_Transformation2' has cardinality 0..*, and from 'transform_Grammar', the role 'transform_Grammar' has cardinality 0..*.
